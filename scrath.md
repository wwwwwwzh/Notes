# Embodied
- Embodiment and AI
- The embodiment process, do we count  every output of the transformation from source domain to maybe amodal representation, the whole thing as the embodied representation
- In languuage processing, words are tokenized. Tokens may seem amodal at first, but they behave embodied: cats and dogs and other furry animals may share similarities in certain feature dimentsions; red objects like apple and a red t-shirt may do the same. If this is considered embodied, then abstract concepts are automatically embodied. Concepts like circular or valuable can be shown to exist close to each other in token space. Moreover, if we consider the itermidiary layers, concepts like time and space are also proven to exist.  
- Helen Keller argument of embodied cognition. Embodied theory posits that activation of modaility specific area is necessary and sufficient for embodied cognition. However, If someone is deprived of certain modailities, would their cognition be embodied?
- spatial relationship of grammar, and in different langauges.
- language (words) learning as improving embodiment
- embodied poem: poems you cite often, which you have mixed so many feelings  and situations in, are greatly embodied [The Experience of Beauty of Chinese Poetry and Its Neural Substrates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30186210/)

### Building the Lagrangian
Our problem is given a start and end position and total time, how will an object move, or what's the trajectory in btw the end points. The least action principle states that ‚à´mv¬≤dt has to be minimized. Without any force, it's easy to see that the object has to follow a straight line with constant speed. This is essentially Newton's first law. Now an object is subject to energy fields. So this effectively becomes a control problem, where the object steers through fields that infleunce it's trajectory and has to minimze total action. Denote the potential energy by V(x). We consider a system with energy conservation, ie, T+V=E where E is constant. Therefore dV=-dT.

### Dot and Cross Product
- "Two (non-parallel) vectors define a plane, and only in three dimensions, **the direction and orientation of a 2D plane can be uniquely determined by a vector perpendicular to it. That is, in 3D there is a natural map between planes through the origin (defined by pairs of non-parallel vectors) and vectors up to a scalar multiple**." https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/349907/cross-product-intuition
- "The concept of the axis of rotation does not generalize to higher dimensions. What does generalize is the plane perpendicular to it. This plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is invariant (it gets mapped to itself) under rotation", "It is the duality between planes and axes (map between a pair of vectors and a single vector perpendicular to them) that allows us to talk about the axis of rotation in 3D."
- "A moving charge at position ùëü‚Éó with velocity ùë¢‚Éó creates a rotating force at the origin attempting to rotate the velocity vector of any charge at the origin in the ùëü‚Éó-ùë¢‚Éó plane. But since in 3D we can identify rotations with their axis instead of their plane, which we love to do because vectors are simpler mathematical objects with known rules than planes, we define this force in terms of a vector ùêµ‚Éó that points outside of this plane. That is the magnetic field"

### Function/Data
What's a function, in application sense? The structure of the world mandates that hidden structure in time and space are related to those observable. Given the appearance of a guy we want to predict his character, given the weather now we want to know that for tommorow. 

When learning, we are learning these structures, appearing as functiioins. A linear function can be used for both spatial and temporal tasks (housing priice is a spatial task). 

Now what part of a function is a data point? Likely it's an x-y pair. Area-price, or time-behavior.


### History of statistics (from status, state of a country) and probability
- Summary: statistics and probability have always been intertwined. **3 branches** of effort converged to modern theory of probability. First is the study of **gambling** where probability were getting defined as a fraction, and where statistics were getting vaguely defined as the long term results of the games. Second is the study of **large amounts of data that were not completely accurate**, beginning with astronomical data and demographic data. This led to the study of distribution of errors, which led to **normal distribution** and methods of least squares. The third was from heat, and the related industrial revolution. The **kinetic theory of gas** naturally led to the convergence to the previous study of large amount of data. All three converged during the 19th century resulting in a theory that says: despite its chaotic appearance, **randomness are in fact controlled by fine structures**, just like those under Newtonian mechanics and mathematical structures. Thus randomness can be studied like any mathematical structures. The first of these structures was **expected value** rooted in gambling problems and later led to Bernoulli's **law of large numbers**. In this case a single value, the mean, gives orders to randomness. Later by studying errors of observations, a complete distribution emerged and led to **normal distribution and central limit theorem**. 
- cont. Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi and Moivre's Doctrine of Chance were istrumental. Bayes published a paper in response to Doctrine of Chance. Combinotorics problems rooted in games have led to covergence with number theory and early forms of fuction analysis with series expasions. Characteristic fuctions and generating funnctios.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#History
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/probability 
- game of chance, combinatorics based and mostly intuition based for things like calculatiing the fraction/probability, see [problem of points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_points). It can be seen that basic notions like expected value was far from intuitive in those times.
    - More on problem of points:
    - The players contribute equally to a prize pot, and agree in advance that the first player to have won a certain number of rounds will collect the entire prize.
    - The starting insight for Pascal and Fermat was that the division should not depend so much on the history of the part of the interrupted game, as on the possible ways the game might have continued. A player with a 7‚Äì5 lead in a game to 10 has the same chance of eventually winning as a player with a 17‚Äì15 lead in a game to 20, and Pascal and Fermat therefore thought that interruption in either of the two situations ought to lead to the same division of the stakes. **In other words, what is important is not the number of rounds each player has won so far, but the number of rounds each player still needs to win in order to achieve overall victory.**
    - Pascal's analysis here is one of the **earliest examples of using expected values instead of odds** when reasoning about probability. Shortly after, this idea would become a basis for the first systematic treatise on probability by Christiaan Huygens.
- Life Annuities, Mortality, other natural observations. This is all about observing phenomena that are not as certain as the stars but follow certain non deterministic laws such that given long enough time or great enough number the laws become deterministic.
- Ars Conjectandi: expected value, Bernoulli trials, law of large number, " From the outset, Bernoulli wished for his work to demonstrate that combinatorics and probability theory would have numerous **real-world applications** in all facets of society, ... and would serve as a **rigorous method of logical reasoning under insufficient evidence**, as used in courtrooms and in moral judgements. It was also hoped that the theory of probability could provide comprehensive and consistent **method of reasoning, where ordinary reasoning might be overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation**."
    - Bernoulli differs from the school of thought known as frequentism, which defined probability in an empirical sense. As a counter, he produces a result resembling the law of large numbers, which he describes as predicting that the **results of observation would approach theoretical probability as more trials were held**. in contrast, **frequents defined probability in terms of the former**. Bernoulli was very proud of this result, referring to it as his "golden theorem", and remarked that it was "a problem in which I've engaged myself for twenty years". This early version of the law is known today as either Bernoulli's theorem or the weak law of large numbers
- Note that it has crystallized that despite being out of control (you can't control tomorrow's weather), and non-predictable (you don't know tomorrow's weather given everything you can know), randomness shows a certain determinism in the long term. See [gambler's ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin) and the above Bernoulli theorem. This long term determinism is predicatble and can be studied like mathematical structures. From a mysticism perspective, the chaos or randomness of the world is made of such underlying structures (the world is made of number (a special type of)). This paves the way for the study of probability to be incorporated to mathematics.
- Energy, gas, entropy, which were non statistical at the time, were later developed into kinetic theory of gases by Maxwell, in which he modelled the gas particles as moving in random directions at random velocities (1859). Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Gibbs. Albert Einstein's mathematical model for Brownian movement.
- Process like Bernoulli, random walk, poisson gave intuition to more profound structures that, with increase in abstraction, naturally gave rise to a more rigorous mathematical field.
- Measure theory and probability theory: in 1900, David Hilbert presented a list of mathematical problems, where his sixth problem asked for a mathematical treatment of physics and probability involving axioms.
- More and more fields began to use this new approach, [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher), physics, economy, demography, information theory, and most importantly quantum physics. 

More on Random walk:
- In 1880, Danish astronomer Thorvald Thiele wrote a paper on the method of least squares, where he used the process to study the errors of a model in time-series analysis. The work is now considered as an early discovery of the statistical method known as **Kalman filtering**
- The French mathematician Louis Bachelier in his 1900 thesis modeled price changes on the Paris stock exchange, without knowing the work of Thiele.
- In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper where he studied the physical observation of Brownian motion or movement to explain the seemingly random movements of particles in liquids by using ideas from the kinetic theory of gases. Einstein derived a differential equation, known as a **diffusion equation**, for describing the probability of finding a particle in a certain region of space
- Einstein's work, as well as experimental results obtained by Jean Perrin, later inspired Norbert Wiener in the 1920s[292] to use a type of measure theory, developed by Percy Daniell, and Fourier analysis to prove the existence of the Wiener process as a mathematical object


## Notes
### (need further work) Adding Trig Functions
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f78m1f5knh

We shall focus on 2 trig functions. The general form is acos(w1t+h1)+bcos(w2+h2)
- Same frequency (w1=w2): result has same frequency, basically scaled and shifted version of cos
- Same phase and amplitude different frequency: frequency difference changes shape of curve. If amplitude difference is big, the curve looks smoother.

### (should be incorportaetd to a more well defined topic) Statistical Modeling of Time Series
- RV
- iid
- stochastic/random process as collection of RVs
- Signal is an instantiation of a random process
- If 2 signal are assumed iid, we can analyze covariance btw 2 RVs
- a stationary process is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time. 
- consider the stochastic process as a markov chain, if the chain changes then it's non stationary. For example, chirp is not.

### PCA, ICA, SVD, Covariance, Eigen
When you calcularte svd, https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs357/sp2021/notes/ref-16-svd.html, you first do A times A^T. That effectively gives you the covariance matrix S. S is a transformation that maps (samples from ) a standard normal distrubution to a normal distribution with S covariance. Therefore svd of S gives PCs. This way, PC means data on that direction is unchanged by the transformatoin. 

### Attention, Covariance, Correlation, Cosine Similarity
#### 
Cosine similarity scales the two vectors to unit length. Correlation scales the two vectors to unit variance. The main part are both dot product. So they are the same up to scaling. Attention diretly use dot product and it can be argued that since the data are alreeady normalized, and since the dimension is big enough, the dot product actually has the role of correlation. But this should not come as a suprise since correlation and cosine similarity can both used to measure distance btw 2 vectors. 

#### Covariance Matrix
Alwways remember that data and distributions/functions are the same thing. 

If x is a direction vector, xSx represents the variance (or weighted variance) of the data in the direction of x. In other words, it gives variance of data if projected onto x.

https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/

Examples of cov matrix and xSx:
- This S means its completely correlated: ![](/images/cov-1-1-1-1.png) Note that the direction in 1,-1 is 0, meaning that variance in that direction is 0: ![](/images/cov-1-1-1-1S.png)
- From these 2 examples you see how correlated the distribution is depends on the ratio of variance of covariance: ![](/images/cov-2-1-1-2.png) Here variance is clearly bigger in 1,1 direction: ![](/images/cov-2-1-1-2S.png)
- This is not postive semi-definite and therefore no distrubution can have this cov matrix: ![](/images/cov-1-2-2-1S.png)


In the context of multivariate statistics, S can be seen as transforming a standard normal random vector into a vector with the covariance structure described by S

In relation to least squares and PCA: in least squares you have x and y and you want a matrix A such that Ax and y is closest. 

### MGF and CLT


Proof that adding Gaussian results in Gaussian
- using standard normal: $g(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$
- Fourier of g: $\mathcal{F}\{g(x)\}(\xi) = \hat{g}(\xi) = \hat{g}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} e^{-2\pi i x \xi} dx = e^{-\frac{\xi^2}{2}}.$
- Multiply Fg and Fg: $e^{-\xi^2}$
- Convolution of 2 normals: $\mathcal{F}^{-1} \left({e^{-\xi^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$
- divide by n square root 

> Odd moments are exclusively related to asymmetries of the distribution. For example the (standardized) third moment is called the ‚Äúskewness‚Äù of the distribution. Even moments are related to the proportion of probability mass located in the tails of the distribution.

### Linear Algebra
there are many applications of LA and each fascilitates a new of visualization. Therefore to build the LA system it's best to build each with reference to some applications grouped by visualization

By subject
- quantum
- dynamics 
- DE
- geometry
- algebra
- graphics
- calculus
- statitistics
- fourier


By visualization

By LA
- Gaussian elimination
- dot product (construct a unit circle and show that dot product between two unit vectors are cosŒ∏‚ÇÅcosŒ∏‚ÇÇ+sinŒ∏‚ÇÅsinŒ∏‚ÇÇ=cos(Œ∏‚ÇÅ-Œ∏‚ÇÇ)=cos(Œ∏‚ÇÇ-Œ∏‚ÇÅ). Any 2 non unit vectors A and B can be seen as $a\hat{A}b\hat{B}=ab\cos(Œ∏_A-Œ∏_B)=a\cos(Œ∏_A)b\cos(Œ∏_B)+a\sin(Œ∏_A)b\sin(Œ∏_B)=A‚ãÖB$)
- determinant (this shoud be invented by solvinng systems of equations. visualization should include the area/volume, and also using the intersection between vectors and planes, eg, if singular, the planes are parrallel, so intersection counts are always in proportion with either ac or bd)
- orthogonality
- subspace (let them find redundency in desctiption of data, say, from monthly inome and annual income to gender and height)
- the 4 subspaces 
    - visual relationship btw row and column space. starting from column space as 3 arrows and the space is linear combination of the arrows. then row space is the space of y that has solution. so it's 3 set of planes made from the row vectors (note these are not the above 3 arrows) with one random arrow denoting x.  
    - using the linearity of intersections, can prove (in 2d case) that if no planes are parallel, then there will always be solutions.  so the space will be such that there's a ratio btw the non parallel planes' axes intersections, ie, their coefficient. In 3d case, the 3 set of planes can be viewed from an angle where all planes are orthogonal to. Therefore, if you draw an arrow, you can only vary two number of intersections. The number of intersectoin from the thrd set of planes is thus a functoin of the other two, ie, the column space is  On the other hand, if the rank is full, the third set will reach out of the view angle so you can fix the other and vary the third. the null space is introduced as both orthogonal to column space and space of x st y is 0. to have a 0 y, the arrow has to be parallel to a set of planes. in 2d this just means having the arrow pointing parallel to the 2 sets of planes which are themself parallel. in 3d, we found the view angle where all planes become lines, the arrow ponitinig out of the viewing plane is therefore parallel to all 3 planes. 
    - the relationship btw column and raw space is convoluted. Starting with column space, the 3 arrows span the space. another 3 arrows are drawn from row space, converted to planes as per column row isomorphism. if the column space is complete, the null space is empty, meaning the 3 planes point in independent directioins, implying their co-vectors, the row vectors are independent. 
    - not sure if a easy visual geometric realtionship exist btw row and column hyperpplanes. 
- determinant again (if determinant is 0, the system of equations can't be satisfied for all y, ie, the column space is smaller than column count. so  )
- eigen
- change of basis (rotation)
- inverse 
- projection

- svd
