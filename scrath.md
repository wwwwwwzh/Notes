- Embodiment and AI
- The embodiment process, do we count  every output of the transformation from source domain to maybe amodal representation, the whole thing as the embodied representation
- In languuage processing, words are tokenized. Tokens may seem amodal at first, but they behave embodied: cats and dogs and other furry animals may share similarities in certain feature dimentsions; red objects like apple and a red t-shirt may do the same. If this is considered embodied, then abstract concepts are automatically embodied. Concepts like circular or valuable can be shown to exist close to each other in token space. Moreover, if we consider the itermidiary layers, concepts like time and space are also proven to exist.  
- Helen Keller argument of embodied cognition. Embodied theory posits that activation of modaility specific area is necessary and sufficient for embodied cognition. However, If someone is deprived of certain modailities, would their cognition be embodied?
- spatial relationship of grammar, and in different langauges.
- language (words) learning as improving embodiment
- embodied poem: poems you cite often, which you have mixed so many feelings  and situations in, are greatly embodied [The Experience of Beauty of Chinese Poetry and Its Neural Substrates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30186210/)
