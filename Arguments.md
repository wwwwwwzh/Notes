People don't beliee in ghosts and want "scsdtific" explaniantion
### On Class
We say it's unfair to have some people raised in good family and have better education. In general, people hate others to have better things "at birth". 

Now imagine randomly assigning children at birth to random families. Will this be fairer? If you think this is fair (people who believe in fairness in "blood"), then it could be argued that fair immediately after birth is just the same as fair at birth. 

Now what about randomly assigning at, say, 18. 

People need different reasons to believe things are fair. Assigning family and assigning attributes are essentially the same. Good family means better chance of better intelligence. Otherwise that intelligence is decided before birth. Either way, it's unfair to me, though people think fairness based on exams which are essentially still based on family and talents is fairer, likely because this way gives them hope.

Like all other social topics, I believe fairness lies only in good heart. Only a common belief of sharing and encouragement and altruism can lead to true fairness.

## Nationalism
- Nations/Cultures shouldn't care if their influence are absorbed by others when they are gone. As long as they contributed to something, they are great cultures. Just like a scientist is great when he contributes to science, not dominate it, in which case he becomes lesser. This is also the reason modern science has steadily progressed for centuries while nations continue to fight each other.

- If a nation forcing their culture on another nation is colonialism, a mind forcing a different mind is also colonialism. 

## Democracy
- Why should we choose to protect natural instincts, the natural impulse to be free and equal, to be happy and virtuous? These impulses are forces, or energy. Energy means work. If we can control these natural forces we unleash great potential of work. A democratic system maximizes global work propelled by such energy. This is also why restrictions of a democracy focus on not infringing others' rights, preventing others from unleashing their energy.

### Materialism
How could materialist believe in power of mind (willpower). In fact, how could they "believe" anything at all.

### City-States
VQ-Gan, europe, evolution, initialization, democracy, individualism, level of individualism

# Projection
- Democracy is the projection of the collective human mind. The collective wisdom of humanity is vast and cannot be adequately represented by any subset of it. 
- If someone says LLM is just learning surface level statistical correspondence, one can argue that humans are such unintelligent machines too. We have stupid people who don't really "understand" things but nevertheless make good enough decisions to stay alive. We also have physicists or even mystics who have deep and bizarre understandings of the world with which they can come up with revolutionary hypothesis. It's just a spectrum. (See BrainThoughts-LLM for how we go deeper in understanding the world)
