# Public
- Nations/Cultures shouldn't care if their influence are absorbed by others when they are gone. As long as they contributed to something, they are great cultures. Just like a scientist is great when he contributes to science, not dominate it, in which case he becomes lesser. This is also the reason modern science has steadily progressed for centuries while nations continue to fight each other.

- If a nation forcing their culture on another nation is colonialism, a mind forcing a different mind is also colonialism. 

# Projection
- Democracy is the projection of the collective human mind. The collective wisdom of humanity is vast and cannot be adequately represented by any subset of it. 
- If someone says LLM is just learning surface level statistical correspondence, one can argue that humans are not good at reconstruction either. We have stupid people who don't really "understand" things but nevertheless make enough good decisions to stay alive. We also have physicists who have deep and strange understanding of the world with which they can come up with revolutionary hypothesis. It's just a spectrum. See BrainThoughts-LLM for how we go deeper in understanding the world.
