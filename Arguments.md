1. Nations/Cultures shouldn't care if their influence are absorbed by others when they are gone. As long as they contributed to something, they are great cultures. Just like a scientist is great when he contributes to science, not dominate it, in which case he becomes lesser. This is also the reason modern science has steadily progressed for centuries while nations continue to fight each other.

# Projection
