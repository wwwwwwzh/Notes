## Asymetric
Relies on the fact that you can easily project (use public key to encrypt message) but not reverse it, and at the same time, there exist a reverse process and an algorithm where the algorithm can generate both the inverse and forward process in a related way but the relation cannot be found easily. 

[how are public and private keys related](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/40362/the-relationship-between-a-private-and-public-key)

- everyone knows the public key
- only you have secret key
- knowing secret key gives you public key but not vice versa

- steps are called instructions (address of involved parties, program address, data)
- a transaction is sent to the cluster to be confirmed (there will be a list of signers on the transaction)
- first signer pays transaction fee
