## Momentum
### Newton's Cradle
Suppose one ball with mass m and velocity v hit another ball at rest. In elastic collision, both momentum and KE are conserved. Let the velocity of the first ball after collision be v1 and that of second be v2.

v1+v2=v by conservation of momentum and v1²+v2²=v² by conservation of KE. Square both side of first equation and get v1²+v2²+2v1v2=v². Thus v1v2=0 so either first or second ball has to be at rest. The first ball cannot go through second ball so only solution is v2=v and v1=0.

In inelastic collision v1+v2=v and KE will be smaller than v². The smallest KE is obtained when v1=v2=0.5v. 

The same reasoning can be applied to more balls. Because momentum must be preserved, moving more mass means proportionally gaining less speed and squared less KE. So to preserve KE, KE of same mass only transfer to same mass.

## Calculus
### Shell Theorem
- A spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its mass were concentrated at a point at its center.
- If the body is a spherically symmetric shell (i.e., a hollow ball), no net gravitational force is exerted by the shell on any object inside, regardless of the object's location within the shell.
