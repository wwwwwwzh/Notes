## Scale
A musical scale is a subset of notes within an octave 

### Major

### Minor
- Natural: half step up after 2 whole steps after first half step and 2 whole step before the end
- Harmonic: raise 7th of natural by half
- Melodic: raise 6th and 7th of natural so only one raising

> Usually, melodic minor is used only when ascending.
When descending, composers prefer to use the natural minor scale

### Scale Degree
Tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, leading tone/subtonic

> Scale Degree can be labeled with number and caret

# Chord
## Triad
### Basic
- Major: Root, major 3rd, perfect 5th (0+4+3)
- Minor: Root, minor 3rd, perfect 5th (0+3+4)
- Augmented: Root, major 3rd, augmented 5th (0+4+4)
- Diminished: Root, minor 3rd, diminished 4th (0+3+3)


### Triad Inversion
- The lowest note, called the bass note, determines the name of the inversion.
- When the lowest note (bass note) is the root of the chord, the triad is in root position.

### Diatonic Triads
- Major: M, m, m, M, M, m, d, M
- Natural Minor: m, d, M, m, m, M, M, m

# Absolute Pitch
## Beginning
### Why we can identify colors but not pitches
- Learning how to produce the pitches and identify them is like being able to use colors and identify colors. 
- we learn absolute colors because color is spatial, ie, we care more about what are the different colors of current visual input at present. In contrast, sound is temporal. We don't just hear a bunch of sounds and try to tell them apart, more often, we hear one sound after anaother and we try to identify this flow of different sounds. That means, we have mechanism built in to process the relativeness of sound and the absoluteness of colors. 

### It's so hard to mentally produce a certain pitch with confidence
That's normal because when you think about other senses, like vision, you'll notice that you can't rteally see the color red when you see it, but you are confident that what you are imagining is red. You can also imagine a touch on your arm or a sweet taste, they are all as fake as your iamginary pitch but as accurate as it needs to be for you to produce the pitch and identify it.
