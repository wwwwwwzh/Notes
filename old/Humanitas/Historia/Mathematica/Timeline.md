All things are numbers

Incommensurable: if a and b are any two non-zero rational numbers, then a and b are commensurable; if a is any irrational number and b is any non-zero rational number, then a and b are incommensurable. On the other hand, if both a and b are irrational numbers, then a and b may or may not be commensurable.

> We can view the curve in two ways. In the early seventeenth century, before calculus arrived, such curves were viewed as geometrical objects. They were considered fascinating in their own right. Mathematicians wanted to quantify their geometrical properties. Given a curve, they wanted to be able to figure out the slope of its tangent line at each point, the arc length of the curve, the area beneath the curve, and so on. In the twenty-first century, we are more interested in the function that produced the curve, which models some natural phenomenon that manifested itself in the curve. The curve is data, but something deeper underlies it. This collision between these two points of view is how the mystery of curves collided with the mysteries of motion and change. It’s how ancient geometry collided with modern science.

> And so, if we were somehow to return to the summer of 1661 and survey the mathematical legacy of the seventeenth century, we would have much of Significance to behold. Algebraic notation, logarithms, analytic geometry, probability, and the theory of numbers-all had come into their own, and the names of Viete, Napier, Descartes, Pascal, and Fermat would be justly revered. They were heroes indeed. Of course, no one on that summer's day would have paid the least attention to the quiet beginning of a mathematical journey that would soon eclipse them all. The journey was to commence at the beautiful Trinity College of Cambridge University in the summer of 1661. -Journey through Genius

> Newton discovered a small set of equations — his laws of motion and gravity — that could explain the mysterious patterns Galileo and Kepler had found in falling bodies on Earth and planetary orbits in the solar system. In so doing, he erased the distinction between the earthly and celestial realms. After Newton, there was just one universe, with the same laws applying everywhere and always.
