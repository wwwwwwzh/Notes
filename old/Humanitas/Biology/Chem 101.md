# Basics
## Atom
- Atom (atomos ‘indivisible’): smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element
- Element: label of atom
- Proton: defines atomic number and thus element 
- Neutron: defines isotope
- Molecule: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms held together by attractive forces known as chemical bonds
- Compound: A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds. A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound.
- Mass number: protons + neutrons
- Atomic mass: an atom of carbon with six neutrons, carbon-12, has an atomic mass of 12 amu
- Atomic weight: expectation of the atomic masses of all the different isotopes in a sample

## Shell & Orbital
- Electron shell: used in Bohr model similar to orbits of planet
- Valence shell and electrons: The number of electrons in the outermost shell of a particular atom determines its reactivity, or tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms.
- Electron orbitals (electrum ‘amber’): region where it's likely to find electrons, each hold up to 2 electrons
- Electron configuration: Neon (1s2 2s2 2p6)


# Bonds

## Intramolecular 
### Ions and ionic bonds
- Ion: Atoms (or molecules) gaining or losing an entire electron
- Cation: positive ions formed by losing electrons
- Anion: negative ions
- Ionic bonds: bonds formed between ions with opposite charges
- Electrolyte: sodium, potassium, and calcium. necessary for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contractions and water balance

### Covalent Bonds
Bonds formed when atoms are sharing electrons. The more electrons that are shared between two atoms, the stronger their bond will be. 

The shared electrons split their time between the valence shells of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, giving each atom something resembling a complete valence shell

- Electronegativity: electronegative atom attracts shared electrons more strongly

- Polar covalent bonds: electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and spend more time close to one atom than the other
- Nonpolar covalent bonds: form between two atoms of the same element, or between atoms of different elements that share electrons more or less equally.

### Why the Difference
- Metals tend to lose electrons easily, while non-metals tend to gain electrons. This is a result of elements' different electronegativity
- Electronegativity of 0.4 to 1.7 is typical for polar covalent bonds. 
- Covalent bonds are formed between non-metal elements while ionic bonds are formed between a metal and a non-metal element
- Covalent bonds are characterized by their strong bond strength and the sharing of electrons 
- Ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, creating ions. These bonds are characterized by their ionic nature and the strong attractive forces between positive and negative ions. Ionic bonds tend to be weaker than covalent bonds

## Intermolecular (Van der Waal)
The attractive or repulsive forces between molecular entities (or between groups within the same molecular entity) other than those due to bond formation or to the electrostatic interaction of ions or of ionic groups with one another or with neutral molecules. The term includes: dipole–dipole, dipole-induced dipole and London (instantaneous induced dipole-induced dipole) forces. The term is sometimes used loosely for the totality of nonspecific attractive or repulsive intermolecular forces.

### Hydrogen bonds
In a polar covalent bond containing hydrogen (e.g., an O-H bond in a water molecule), the hydrogen will have a slight positive charge because the bond electrons are pulled more strongly toward the other element. Because of this slight positive charge, the hydrogen will be attracted to any neighboring negative charges. This interaction is called a hydrogen bond.

### Dipole-Dipole
Intermolecular or intramolecular interaction between molecules or groups having a permanent electric dipole moment.

### London dispersion forces
Because electrons are in constant motion, there will be some moments when the electrons of an atom or molecule are clustered together, creating a partial negative charge in one part of the molecule (and a partial positive charge in another). If a molecule with this kind of charge imbalance is very close to another molecule, it can cause a similar charge redistribution in the second molecule, and the temporary positive and negative charges of the two molecules will attract each other.

### Summary
ionic bonds are completely polar bonds 
Covalent and ionic bonds are both typically considered strong bonds.

Hydrogen bonds and London dispersion forces are both examples of van der Waals forces, a general term for intermolecular interactions that do not involve covalent bonds or ions.

strong covalent bonds hold together the chemical building blocks that make up a strand of DNA. However, weaker hydrogen bonds hold together the two strands of the DNA double helix. These weak bonds keep the DNA stable, but also allow it to be opened up for copying and use by the cell.

## Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions occur when chemical bonds between atoms are formed or broken. The substances that go into a chemical reaction are called the reactants, and the substances produced at the end of the reaction are known as the products.

Some chemical reactions simply run in one direction until the reactants are used up. These reactions are said to be irreversible. Other reactions, however, are classified as reversible. 

Reversible reactions can go in both the forward and backward directions. At equilibrium, the forward and backward reactions are still happening, but the relative concentrations of products and reactants no longer change. Each reaction has its own characteristic equilibrium point, which we can describe with a number called the equilibrium constant.

### Cohesion
Cohesion refers to the attraction of molecules for other molecules of the same kind, and water molecules have strong cohesive forces thanks to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with one another.

Cohesion on surface of water is called surface tension

### Adhesion
Adhesion is the attraction of molecules of one kind for molecules of a different kind, and it can be quite strong for water, especially with other molecules bearing positive or negative charges.

Adhesion enables water to “climb” upwards through thin glass tubes (called capillary tubes) placed in a beaker of water. This upward motion against gravity, known as capillary action

### States of Water
In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly being formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. The breaking of these bonds is caused by the energy of motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system.

in ice, the water molecules are pushed farther apart than they are in liquid water.

## Specific Heat Capacity
Definition: amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius

This amount is one calorie

It takes a lot of heat to increase the temperature of liquid water because some of the heat must be used to break hydrogen bonds between the molecules.

## Acid and Base
An acidic solution has a high concentration of hydrogen ions H+ greater than that of pure water.

### Concentration of H+ in Water
H2O->H+ + OH-

H+ directly forms H3O+ but scientists still refer to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free-floating

This concentration is 1E-7 moles per liter of water

### pH
ph = -log10[H+]

The pH inside human cells (6.8) and the pH of blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral.

### Buffer


## Carbon
### Why Carbon in Life
- Carbon-carbon bonds are unusually strong
- Because a C atom can form covalent bonds to as many as four other atoms, it’s well suited to form the basic skeleton, or “backbone,” of a macromolecule.
