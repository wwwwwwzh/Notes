# Ideas
- Belgians supported a unitary system over the federal models suggested by ABAKO and CONAKAT









Lumumba's ideal of an unified Congolese national identity contradicts some powerful figures' political, cultural and economic interest, which leads to a deadlock Lumumba attempted to resolve with war. Yet he failed to rally political and military support neither domestically nor internationally, and further gradually lost his only few allies.

One paragraph will explain how Lumumba's radical ideas doesn't align with many's and how that leads to difficulties in forming his government which eventually antagonized many important figures (mainly those in Kasai and Katanga)

One will elaborate how his relationship with Belgium, UN, and US deteriorated, especially after invasion of south Kasai.

One will focus on the most direct cause of his demise: he alienated Mobutu and Kasavubu. One subargument is that both Mobutu and Kasavubu are more moderate and hoped to solve the problem at hand which Lumumba disagreed.


# People 
## Tshombe
The Tshombe family were Lunda royalty and a number of Tshombes had reigned as the Mwaant Yav, the traditional king of the Lunda people.

Both CONAKAT and the Union Katangaise wanted very broad autonomy for Katanga within an independent Congo in order to keep the wealth generated by the mining industry within Katanga.[6] In contrast to CONAKAT with its calls for autonomy and curbs on "immigration", the "immigrants" in Katanga tended to favor the parties that called for a more centralized state.

In 1959, Belgian profits from the Union Miniere were in excess of 3.5 billion Belgian francs, and export duties paid to the Congolese government constituted 50% of the government's revenue.

During the province's secession, the Union transferred 1.25 billion Belgian francs (35 million USD) into Tshombe's bank account, an advance on 1960 taxes which should in fact have been paid to Lumumba's government.

L hoped to gain Katanga into CCongo but instead lost what he had. His international and internal relationship rapidly deteriorated. 
belief of a unified Congo (105) vs federalist, analyze Tshombe

US and Belgian NATO relatioinship

refusing categorically the request and advising that multilateral aid through the UN was preferable

the US underlined its fear of Soviet intervention by dispatching the aircraft carrier Wasp to the Congo coast. Officially the mission was to evacuate American civilians if needed.19 

We are talking of one man [Lumumba] … being supported by the Soviets … and forcing us out of the Congo,” President Eisenhower declared.25 

the Special Group agreed on August 25 not to rule out “any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba.”26 

Ambassador Clare Timberlake in Leopoldville, who was also a career diplomat, maintained close association with European diplomats in the Congo’s capital and was a strong advocate of European interests. 



background of L

uncompromising anti imperialist stance leads to rejection of Belgian and US aid



start of domino effect when L refused Belgian aid to protect its own citizens. This combined with his continued ineptitude to quell further mutinies and reduce misconducts of his soldiers conttributed significantly to Belgian support for Katanga

belgium philosophy
The Belgian government subsequently announced that it would provide for Belgian bureaucrats back in the metropole, triggering an exodus of most of the Congo's 10,000 European civil servants and leaving the administration in disarray.[45] Engulfed by the disorder spreading throughout the country, most of the government ministries were unable to function.

Encouraged by the UMHK, the Belgian government provided military support to Katanga and ordered its civil servants in the region to remain in their posts.

when UN forces came, Lumumba wanted them to fight with ANC which they rejected. Another direct consequence of having to fight an all out war after irresolvable difference

analyze Mobuto and Kasavubu

By comparison with his boss, Mobutu was a pillar of pragmatism and common sense. It was to him that we appealed when our people were arrested by Lumumba's hashish-stimulated guards.

The Belgian intervention divided Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu; while Kasa-Vubu accepted the Belgian operation,[42] Lumumba denounced it and called for "all Congolese to defend our republic against those who menace it."
