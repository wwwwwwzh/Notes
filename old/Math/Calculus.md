Reductio ad Absurdum:  a proposition Q and its negation ¬Q cannot both be true. Therefore, if a proposition and its negation can both be derived logically from a premise, it can be concluded that the premise is false.

Method of exhaustion: is a method of finding the area of a shape by inscribing inside it a sequence of polygons whose areas converge to the area of the containing shape. If the sequence is correctly constructed, the difference in area between the nth polygon and the containing shape will become arbitrarily small as n becomes large. The method of exhaustion typically required a form of proof by contradiction, known as reductio ad absurdum.

Archimedean Number System: a number x is infinite if it satisfies the conditions |x|>1, |x|>1+1, |x|>1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if x≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for x and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

Law of Continuity: the rules of the finite are found to succeed in the infinite.

Transcendental law of homogeneity: in a sum involving infinitesimals of different orders, only the lowest-order term must be retained, and the remainder discarded


Infinitesimal number: a quantity that is closer to zero than any standard real number, but that is not zero

Limit: the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.

Note that in infinite sequence, approaching infinity means for all n > some N. What is n?
