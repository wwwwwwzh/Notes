We start with a simple theme that defines a powerful relationship and two central variables upon which all other physical quantities are defined. 

That is: as time flows, things change. Thus we have time (t) and matter. Implied here is space within which "change" can take place. For current discussion change means "movement".

So first question is why things move. A series of clever questions and answers led to Galileo's law of inertia, and then Newton's laws. We invented things like force, inertia and momentum. Our picture at this point is that things move in straight line at predefined unchanging speed. No one knows why but it's a good enough analysis. Then things also interact. They interact from a distance and when they "touch". Such interaction is said to apply force on the interacting entities. The force changes their state of movement and do so according to their mass or inertia. 

A even grander picture at this point after Newton is that everything works this way. Everything is made of tiny points that interact with each other. The force always lies on the line connecting them and Newton's laws always apply. Thus we can calculate the world at any point in time. 


# Thermodynamics
## Heat, Substance, Air 
The ancients viewed heat as that related to fire. Heraclitus: "All things are flowing." Heraclitus argued that the three principal elements in nature were fire, earth, and water. (energy, two states of matter)

Parmenides: air is a substance

Leucippus and Democritus: atomic theory

"Heat is Motion" (Francis Bacon)

## Momentum
Descartes (1637) and Leibniz (1686): The same work is necessary to raise body A of 1 pound to a height of 4 yards, as is necessary to raise body B of 4 pounds to a height of 1 yard.

In Principles of Philosophy from 1644, Descartes defined "quantity of motion" (Latin: quantitas motus) as the product of size and speed, and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved. 

> [God] created matter, along with its motion ... merely by letting things run their course, he preserves the same amount of motion ... as he put there in the beginning.

Leibniz's vis viva: E ∝ mv2

Newcommen's steam engine 1697

Newton's law of cooling (1702) The rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the temperatures between the body and its environment.

## phlogiston
The theory of phlogiston arose in the 17th century, late in the period of alchemy. Its replacement by caloric theory in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry. Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from combustible substances during burning, and from metals during the process of rusting.

### Caloric theory
In the mid to late 18th century, heat was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the caloric.

Joseph Black and Antoine Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimete

Benjamin Thompson: boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction

## Kinetic Theory of Gas
The first written scientific reflection on the microscopic nature of heat is probably to be found in a work by Mikhail Lomonosov (1738), in which he wrote: movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen

Daniel Bernoulli published his book Hydrodynamics (1738): PV=2/3U

Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture

Further progress in kinetic theory started only in the middle of the 19th century, with the works of Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, and Ludwig Boltzmann.

Quantitative studies by Joule from 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, and helped to place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. In 1843, Joule experimentally found the mechanical equivalent of heat. In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819 ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of conservation of energy and explained why heat can do work

Carl Wilhelm Scheele distinguished heat transfer by thermal radiation (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777.

Sadi Carnot, the "father of thermodynamics", who in 1824 published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, a discourse on heat, power, and engine efficiency. 

Carnot defined "motive power" to be the expression of the useful effect that a motor is capable of producing. Herein, Carnot introduced us to the first modern day definition of "work": weight lifted through a height. The desire to understand, via formulation, this useful effect in relation to "work" is at the core of all modern day thermodynamics.
