A **state** is a centralized political organization that imposes and enforces rules over a population within a territory.

A **nation** is a community of people formed on the basis of a combination of shared features such as language, history, ethnicity, culture and/or society. A nation is thus the collective identity of a group of people understood as defined by those features.

A **nation-state** is a political unit where the state and nation are congruent. It is a more precise concept than "country", since a country does not need to have a predominant ethnic group.

An **ethnic group or an ethnicity** is a grouping of people who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. Those attributes can include common sets of traditions, ancestry, race, language, history, society, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.

A **country** is a distinct part of the world, such as a state, nation, or other political entity.

A **sovereign state** is a state that has the highest jurisdiction over a territory. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory (see territorial disputes), a government not under another, and has the capacity to interact with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is independent.

A **government** is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.
