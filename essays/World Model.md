When playing a game like Minecraft, we know how to walk around, collect and  craft things because we first have a rough idea, upon seeing the first frame of the game, that this bear resemblance to the real world where the most intuitive thing to do is to walk around and explore. Control buttons are memorized before and we can imagine how they correspond to actions in the game, and adjust our memory according to what actions they really lead to, an example of implicit learning. Our vast world model helps make every decisions in further game play. We know that wood is good crafting material, that skeletons and spiders are likely to be avoided, that iron equipments are better than leather or wooden ones. Again, these are all knowledge stored through decades of observation of the real world and we might not be aware of this accumulation.
