> Fundamental ideas play the most essential role in forming a physical theory. Books on physics are full of complicated mathematical formulae. But thought and ideas, not formulae, are the beginning of every physical theory. The ideas must later take the mathematical form of a quantitative theory, to make possible the comparison with experiment. -Einstein

# Understanding Physics
> Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. -Einstein

### Equations
## Physics as a Science of Change
### Base Units
These are the only things we can measure. They are of course themselves imagined by humans, but they are good starting points, which are ultimately based on truth by seeing, a revolution from Greek science of truth of the high/forms/ideas to empiricism. 

- Length (m): where in space (angle can be derived from length)
- Time (s): change of space
- Mass (kg): not weight (measured in Newton)
- Current (A): 
- Temperature (K):
- Quantity (mole): 
- Brightness:

### Note on Physical Laws
Physical laws are usually written as equations like F=ma. There are many ways to interpret an equation. One is to imagine a plane through 3D space where everything on that plane represents a possible F,m,a combination in our universe. Or that when holding one thing constant, like F, what will happen to m  when changing a. 

This helps you understand the numerical relationship between things. But you could also use an equation to loosely define things. For example, in F=ma you could define force as m times a or define mass as force divided by acceleration (acceleration itself is defined clearly as a second derivative of easily measurable units so probably no need to redefine). Note however that this helps you understand certain aspects of the quantities involved. A force can "exist" without acceleration: e.g. objects on earth without relative movement experience gravity all the time. In addition, if we define force this way, then imagine you accelerating while watching me standing still, it would seem that I am being pulled by some mysterious force ().

### Where it is


### Change of Where it is
After being able to observe and note down where things are, we notice that things change where they are. An object at location a might, after some time, be seen at location b. We denote this change as displacement. 

The world is sadly too continuous for humans, and things change continuously. Every moment things change where they are. When describing a continuously moving object, it's insufficient to measure its location at intervals, no matter how small those intervals are. There's always a hidden process in between the two small measured locations that may or may not be of interest. So we ask, can location along describe the state of the world or maybe there's something else as intrinsic as location that's underlying every object? We give it the name speed. At the moment, we don't know how the property "speed" is related to locations, but miraculously, there's a mathematically accurate way to relate this speed with location and displacement. 

> Math of change: we have now discovered 2 property of things that are of interest to us but that may or may not be related. It turns out that through experiments, the derivative of distance IS speed. The inspiration we had of taking smaller and smaller intervals ad infinitum actually give us a definite number. We hope this number is speed, it looks like speed, it works as if it's speed, it matches everything we want in a property we have called speed, so it is speed. One of the important mathematical property of this speed we calculated with calculus is that its anti-derivative IS distance. So no more philosophical questions on whether the hypothetical speed really is the mathematical speed or not as long as t does the job. This is miraculous and groundbreaking and that's why Newton named his work mathematical principles of natural philosophy, no one before him had proved to such an extent the relationship between math and nature. 

### Change of Where for a Certain Object (Momentum)
The word here doesn't matter. Historically it's been given many names but "momentum" became the consensus. Newton for example simply used "motion". 

### Change of Momentum (Force)
Force changes momentum. It's just like how speed changes location. It's the derivative of momentum: dp/dt=df. 

### Why Things Move
The discussion till now had been about what is motion and how do things move. Naturally we want to ask why do they move at all. It's perfectly reasonable to imagine a universe where nothing moves. So what is there in our universe that make things go around. 

(Greek)

Till Enlightenment, the word for the problem was "vis viva" or living force. It's the thing in wind, waves, and living things that make themselves or others move. This, together with many other related concepts, gave rise to two modern concepts about mechanism of motion: force and energy. Force had long been described and used in engineering but Newton made the groundbreaking discovery that force changes momentum, or F=ma. 

### Heads Up
This section serves as a primer on how physics studies change. Future sections will also rely on this idea and are by no means separated based on whether they are topics of change or not.

## Universal Gravitation
> While we are admiring the human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a nature that could follow with such completeness and generality such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. -Feynman

### Copernicus
The law of universal gravitation could hardly been found without Copernicus' heliocentric theory. Though motion is relative and it's not wrong to say everything revolves around earth, the heliocentric theory offers a better coordinate system to study the motion of the planets. A comprehensive law would be impossible if earth were considered the frame of reference. 

### Kepler's Laws
- Each star follows the sun in ellipse, with the sun at one of the foci.
- The line connecting star and sun sweeps out equal area in equal time.
- T^2~a^3

## Time
> we find that the regularity of one kind fits the regularity of another kind


## Energy
### Development
(direct research needed) The concept of energy is old and is just how one would intuitively think it is. It's the feeling that moving things, the sun, the waves of water, etc contain something in common which they called energy. Energy was later largely taken as the "vis viva" in which moving things contain a certain force. Parralell to all this is the philosophical idea that the elements in the universe "flows" but never changes and there's a heavenly balance controlling this flow which later became the conservation of XXX. The energy in living things was thought by Newton to be mv and he thought this quantity is conserved. However, imagine a particle with v speed hit another same mass particle and afterwards the first particle moves backward at -2v and the hit particle moves at 3v. Energy is conserved but everything moved faster. Later it was revised to be mv². 

Using the newly defined kinetic energy one can define how it will convert to height. With speed v going upward a particle of mass m will stop at height v²/2g. This height times 2mg would equal mv². So we say the mv² at the bottom has been converted to 2hmg and that the quantity 2hmg means we can convert it back to a speed of v. 

"It was soon recognized that these kinds of energy, mechanical and heat, are many forms. Everything which can be converted into either of them is also a form of energy."

## Mechanical View
> Finally, therefore, we discover the material science to be to refer natural problem of physical phenomena back to unchangeable attractive and repulsive forces whose intensity depends wholly upon distance. The solubility of this problem is the condition of the complete comprehensibility of nature. -Helmholtz

In mechanics the future path of a moving body can be predicted and its past disclosed if its present condition and the forces acting upon it are known. Thus, for example, the future paths of all planets can be foreseen. The active forces are Newton's gravitational forces depending on the distance alone.

The great results of classical mechanics suggest that the mechanical view can be consistently applied to all branches of physics, that all phenomena can be explained by the action of forces representing either attraction or repulsion, depending only upon distance and acting between unchangeable particles.

In the kinetic theory of matter we see how this view, arising from mechanical problems, embraces the phenomena of heat and how it leads to a successful picture of the structure of matter.

### Newtonian Universe

### Kinetic Theory of Gas

### Brownian Motion

### Magnetic
the tendency to describe all phenomena by means of attractive and repulsive forces depending only on distance and acting between unchangeable particles.

### Space Time Matter Momentum Force Energy Heat Electron

Force changes momentum, heat changes temperature, electric charge changes electric potential. We have seen that energy is tightly connected, and in some sense defined on motion. The notion of energy comes from questions about why things move. Everything moves, and everything has energy. All the changes listed above then are changes of energy. 

Flow of energy changes movement of matter we see. In the next chapter we shall see that when enough seeing/observations are given that we have a consistent theory to explain for, we might discard the notion of tangible matters and claim that all is energy, only the flow of energy matters.


# Fiction of Mind
> Modern physics is simpler than the old physics and seems, therefore, more difficult and intricate. The simpler our picture of the external world and the more facts it embraces, the more strongly it reflects in our minds the harmony of the universe. -Einstein

## Energy

## Entropy
### History
- Energy lost in mechanical work (Lazare Carnot): in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts all represent losses of moment of activity, i.e. the useful work done. From this Carnot drew the inference that perpetual motion was impossible. This loss of moment of activity was the first-ever rudimentary statement of the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of 'transformation-energy' or entropy, i.e. energy lost to dissipation and friction.

- Heat lost in ideal engine (Sadi Carnot): "some caloric is always lost" in the conversion into work, even in his idealized reversible heat engine. He also discovered that this idealized efficiency was dependent only on the temperatures of the heat reservoirs between which the engine was working, and not on the types of working fluids

- The algebraic sum of all the transformations occurring in a cyclical process can only be positive, or, as an extreme case, equal to nothing.

### Macrostate Variables
It would be nice to have some quantity either directly observable or calculable  on a complex system, such that even though we don't know what's happening at lower levels, we can find rules or laws governing these varibles themseves, as if such laws are themselves the laws of the universe. And in fact they are. And in fact we have been dealing with these floating high and imaginary quantities for a long time. For example, we never defined mass as a function of the microscopic combination of its atoms or even sub-atomic structures, we just say this big complex thing has such mass, and it's a useful quantity. The laws like F=ma are all every macro compared to what we now know. The point is, it is ok to use such fuzzy overall descriptions of the world instead of cutting it up into infinitesimal pieces. 

When studying thermodynamics, or gas, we don't care what each air molecule is doing, we care about something big and these things are actually useful. It's intuitive to have measures like pressure and volume and temperature. They are easy to measure and useful. What else do we need? Remember that temperature is not heat. If temperature is high (say 200F) on a small ball, and imagine heat as flow of some imaginary particle, some heat will flow to you when you touch it, but a huge ball with lower temperature (say 150F), can deliver much more such "heat". So it seems we need to have a variable called heat. It's later discovered that heat is a form of energy, another imaginary macrostate variable that's useful. So with the first law we know the lost heat energy is converted to work. If we describe the system with heat energy, we notice that with each cycle of a heat engine, some net heat is added to the engine. But we want a macrostate variable that's conserved during each cycle since apparently the whole system looks the same after each cycle. Also we know we can't use temperature since we can't differentiate between a big system and a small one. So we invent a thing called entropy. 

## Gibbs Free Energy
https://qr.ae/ps1evZ

## Entropy and Life
The 1944 book What is Life? by Nobel-laureate physicist Erwin Schrödinger stimulated further research in the field. In his book, Schrödinger originally stated that life feeds on negative entropy, or negentropy as it is sometimes called, but in a later edition corrected himself in response to complaints and stated that the true source is free energy. More recent work has restricted the discussion to Gibbs free energy because biological processes on Earth normally occur at a constant temperature and pressure,

Applying Boltzmann's perspective of the second law, the change of state from a more probable, less ordered, and higher entropy arrangement to one of less probability, more order, and lower entropy (as is seen in biological ordering) calls for a function like that known of DNA. DNA's apparent information-processing function provides a resolution of the Schrödinger paradox posed by life and the entropy requirement of the second law

## Field 
### Electromagnetism
> Not only does the force fail to lie on the line connecting charge and magnet, but the intensity of the force depends on the velocity of the charge. The whole mechanical point of view was based on the belief that all phenomena can be explained in terms of forces depending only on the distance and not on the velocity.

### Reality of Field
- Reality of Force
- Reality of Energy
- Combining force and substance: By knowing the position and velocity of a particle at one single instant, path of the particle could be foreseen. In Maxwell's theory, if we know the field at one instant only, we can whole field will change in space and time (Einstein).

### Coordinate System and Frame of Reference

### Galilean Relativity
if the laws of mechanics are valid in one c.s., then they are valid in any other c.s. moving uniformly relative to the first.

"Good" co-ordinate systems, that for which the laws of mechanics are valid, we those call inertial systems. The question as to whether an inertial system exists at all is still unsettled. But if there one such system, then there is an infinite number of them.

### Speed of Sound
The observer in the room claims: the velocity of sound is, for me, the same in all directions. The outside observer claims: the velocity of sound, spreading in the moving room and determined in my c.s., is not the same in all directions. It is greater than the standard velocity of sound in the direction of the motion of the room and smaller in the opposite direction.

### Speed of Light
Air in the room vs ether

### New Transformation Law from 2 Observations
- The velocity of light in vacuo is the same in all c.s. moving uniformly, relative to each other. 
- All laws of nature are the same in all c.s. moving uniformly, relative to each other

if the velocity of light is the same in all c.s., then moving rods must change their length, moving clocks must change their rhythm, and the laws governing these changes are rigorously determined.
