### Shell Theorem
- A spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its mass were concentrated at a point at its center.
- If the body is a spherically symmetric shell (i.e., a hollow ball), no net gravitational force is exerted by the shell on any object inside, regardless of the object's location within the shell.
