# 5. Molecular Genetics
- [Barbara McClintock, Transposons](https://youtu.be/dFILgg9_hrU?t=1331)
- [Transposon in early brain development](https://youtu.be/dFILgg9_hrU?t=1882)
- [Number of copies of gene, backup, more protein, free to evolve](https://youtu.be/dFILgg9_hrU?t=2862)

# 6 Behavioral Genetics I
- [to study how behavior come from genetic differences, environment must be controlled but this is difficult, monozygotic and fraternal twin, prenatal development of twins, gender]
- [math score gender study]
- [schizophrenia adoption study show evidence of genetic cause for psychological disease]
- [problem with adoption study: prenatal shared environment, paternity uncertainty]
- [prenatal influence, hormone in rats, inheriting non genetic traits (non-mendelian inheritance)]
- [dutch hunger winter, metabolic programming: low food->pancreas produce more insulin->obesity->non mendelian inheritance of this trait, fetal origins of adult disease]
- [prenatal learning, preference influenced before born]
- [mitochondria and transcription factors, Lamarckian inheritance]
- [indirect inheritance]

# 7 Behavioral Genetics II
- [molecular genetics technique enable more accurate description of behavioral genetics, 2 approaches: identify gene that cause something from two groups of people; observe effects of different strains of genes on well studied genes]
- [randomness in addition to nature vs nurture: mitochondria and other stuff in cytoplasm](https://youtu.be/RG5fN6KrDJE?t=1926)
- [heritability (not how gene relates to trait but how gene affect degree of variability of trait) and how it interacts with environment: a gene leading to a disease might have no or even better effects in certain environment; a 100% or 0% heritable event might not relate to gene at all (number of fingers, wear earrings)](https://youtu.be/RG5fN6KrDJE?t=2489)
- [the above leads to the conclusion that instead of asking what a gene goes behaviorally, one should really ask what it does under a certain environment](https://youtu.be/RG5fN6KrDJE?t=4310)
- [several examples on how environment affects heritability of genes: depression, aggression, IQ, math]
- ["human genes code for ways which you have freedom from genetics (as compared to other animals like chimps)"](https://youtu.be/RG5fN6KrDJE?t=5540)

# 8 Relatives
- [chutes and ladders, IQ and order of birth to show how scientifically reliable data doesn't mean it's significant]
- [mechanism for identifying relatives: personal identifier protein as a result of major histocompatibility complex, lock and key mechanism receptor]
- [side note on how everyone has a unique Human Leukocyte Antigen complex (human version of MHC) that make your signature protein to help immune system determine pathogen, also reason for organ transplant failure]
- [vasopressin and oxytocin, olfactory neurogenesis]
- [third cousin](https://youtu.be/P388gUPSq_I?t=3229)
- [imprinting as second mechanism for recognizing relatives, smell of fluids, cognitive thinking (baboon, fish), fusiform cortex (face module) and autism, Israel and Taiwan example](https://youtu.be/P388gUPSq_I?t=3487)

# 9 Ethology
- [BF Skinner, Environmentalist, Behaviorist,vs ethologist]
- [study animal behavior in their own language (natural habitat)]
- [behaviors are hardwired (fixed action pattern) but could be changed by environment, squirrel, animal on glass, monkey, smiling examples](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=1087)
- [use experiment to show what an action's adaptive value is, Von Frisch and his bee ](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=1827)
- [studying the stimuli for fixed action patterns: replacement, substitution, super-stimulation...](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=2179)
- [Mickey example](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=3271)
- [Neuroethology to explain mechanisms for stimuli-reaction pathway]
- [non instinctive actions/learning, imprinting](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=3890)
- [prepared learning, sauce Bearnaise and opera, human fear of spider and snakes](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=4507)
- [Donald Griffin and animal awareness, self awareness and mirror experiment](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=5080)
- [theory of mind, examples of flexible cognitive strategies](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=5803)
- [numerosity, transitive thinking](https://youtu.be/ISVaoLlW104?t=6014)
