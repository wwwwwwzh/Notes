# Termonology
- System: Latin systema "an arrangement, system,"
- Tissue: Latin texere ‘to weave’
- Cell: Latin cella ‘storeroom or chamber’.
- Molecule: Latin moles ‘mass’.

# Physics Review
## Newton's Laws of Motion
1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.
2. When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its momentum equals the force.
3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

## Thermodynamics
Entropy measures disorder, randomness, or uncertainty.
1. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another
2. The entropy of an isolated system will always increase over time (local decrease in entropy occurring locally is always accompanied by a larger increase after the process)

## Misc
### Motion
- Momentum (p) = Mass (m) x Velocity (v)
- Force (F) = ΔP = m x Δv = Mass (m) x Acceleration (a)

### Energy
Energy is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light.

Energy is the ability to do work/cause change


- Work (W) = Force (F) x Distance (d)
- Power (P) = Work (W) / Time (t)
- Kinetic Energy (KE) = 1/2 x Mass (m) x Velocity (v)^2
energy an object has due to its motion.
- Potential Energy (PE) = Mass (m) x Gravity (g) x Height (h). It's energy an object has due to its position or configuration. 
- Total Energy (E) = Kinetic Energy (KE) + Potential Energy (PE)
- Thermal energy: a kind of kinetic energy. constant, random bouncing of atoms or molecules
- Chemical energy: the energy in the chemical bonds of a molecule is related to the structure of the molecule and the positions of its atoms relative to one another

carbohydrates (such as sugars), lipids (such as fats), proteins, and nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA).

Most large biological molecules are polymers, long chains made up of repeating molecular subunits, or building blocks, called monomers.

## Carbohydrates

### Ring Form

## Lipids
Fats are one type of lipid, a category of molecules united by their inability to mix well with water. Lipids tend to be hydrophobic, nonpolar, and made up mostly of hydrocarbon chains

### Fats
- A fat molecule consists of two kinds of parts: a glycerol backbone and three fatty acid tails.
- Fat molecules are also called triacylglycerols, or triglycerides. 
- In the human body, triglycerides are primarily stored in specialized fat cells, called adipocytes, which make up a tissue known as adipose tissue

### Waxes

### Phospholipids

### Steroids
- All steroids have four linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, also have a short tail.
- Although they do not resemble the other lipids structurally, steroids are included in lipid category because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water. 


## Nucleic Acids
DNA and RNA are polymers (in the case of DNA, often very long polymers), and are made up of monomers known as nucleotides

## Proteins
### Amino Acids
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. Specifically, a protein is made up of one or more linear chains of amino acids, each of which is called a polypeptide. There are 20 types of amino acids commonly found in proteins.
