# CNS
## Neuron
### Structure
- Central nervous system (CNS): The brain and spinal cord.
- Peripheral nervous system (PNS): The part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord, including the nerves attached to the brain and spinal cord. 

- Soma: The cell body of a neuron, which contains the nucleus.
- Dendrite: A branched, treelike structure attached to the soma of a neuron; receives information from the terminal buttons of other neurons.
- Synapse: A junction between the terminal button of an axon and the membrane of another neuron.
- Axon: The long, thin, cylindrical structure that conveys information from the soma of a neuron to its terminal buttons.
- Terminal button: The bud at the end of a branch of an axon; forms synapses with another neuron; sends information to that neuron.

- Multipolar neuron: A neuron with one axon and many dendrites attached to its soma.
- Bipolar neuron: A neuron with one axon and one dendrite attached to its soma. Bipolar neurons are usually sensory.
- Unipolar neuron: A neuron with one axon attached to its soma; the axon divides, with one branch receiving sensory information and the other sending the information into the central nervous system. The dendrites of most unipolar neurons detect touch, temperature changes, and other sensory events that affect the skin. Other unipolar neurons detect events in our joints, muscles, and internal organs.

### Intra Neuron Communication
Neurons pump Na+ outside to maintain negative resting potential and activates by 2 other pumps that increase to positive action potential and decrease afterwards.

- Resting potential: The membrane potential of a neuron when it is not being altered by excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials; approximately –70 mV in the giant squid axon.

- Depolarization: Reduction (toward zero) of the membrane potential of a cell from its normal resting potential. 
- Hyperpolarization: An increase in the membrane potential of a cell, relative to the normal resting potential.
- Action potential The brief electrical impulse that provides the basis for conduction of information along an axon.
- Threshold of excitation The value of the membrane potential that must be reached to produce an action potential.
- Sodium–potassium transporter A protein found in the membrane of all cells that extrudes sodium ions from and transports potassium ions into the cell. Up to 40 percent of a neuron’s metabolic resources are used to operate them.

### Inter Neuron 
Neurotransmitters bind to ionotropic or metabotropic receptors that open up 3 kinds of ion channels. Reuptake or enzyme digestion afterwards.

Synapses can occur in three places: on dendrites, on the soma, and on other axons. These synapses are referred to as axodendritic, axosomatic, and axoaxonic.

- Ionotropic receptor (eye on oh trow pik) A receptor that contains a binding site for a neurotransmitter and an ion channel that opens when a molecule of the neurotransmitter attaches to the binding site.
- Metabotropic receptor (meh tab oh trow pik) A receptor that contains a binding site for a neurotransmitter; activates an enzyme that begins a series of events that opens an ion channel elsewhere in the cell’s membrane when a molecule of the neurotransmitter attaches to the binding site.
- G protein A protein coupled to a metabotropic receptor; conveys messages to other molecules when a ligand binds with and activates the receptor.
- Second messenger A chemical produced when a G protein activates an enzyme; carries a signal that results in the opening of the ion channel or causes other events to occur in the cell.

- Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
- Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)

- Reuptake The reentry of a neurotransmitter just liberated by a terminal button back through its membrane, thus terminating the postsynaptic potential.
- Enzymatic deactivation The destruction of a neurotransmitter by an enzyme after its release—for example, the destruction of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase.
- Acetylcholine (ACh) (a see tul koh leen) A neurotransmitter found in the brain, spinal cord, and parts of the peripheral nervous system; responsible for muscular contraction.

## Supporting Cells
- Glia: The supporting cells of the central nervous system.
- Astrocyte: A glial cell that provides support for neurons of the central nervous system, provides nutrients and other substances, and regulates the chemical composition of the extracellular fluid.
- Phagocytosis (fagg o sy toe sis) The process by which cells engulf and digest other cells or debris caused by cellular degeneration.
- Oligodendrocyte (oh li go den droh site) A type of glial cell in the central nervous system that forms myelin sheaths.
- Myelin sheath (my a lin) A sheath that surrounds axons and insulates them, preventing messages from spreading between adjacent axons.
- Node of Ranvier (run vee ay) A naked portion of a myelinated axon, between adjacent oligodendroglia or Schwann cells.
- Schwann cell A cell in the peripheral nervous system that is wrapped around a myelinated axon, providing one segment of its myelin sheath.
- Blood–brain barrier A semipermeable barrier between the blood and the brain produced by the cells in the walls of the brain’s capillaries.

### Terminology
- Pituitary: 1610s, from Latin pītuītārius (“mucous”), from pītuīta (“clammy moisture, phlegm, mucus, slime”). Taken as the name for the gland because it was believed that it channeled mucus to the nose.
- Hypothalamus: 1893 in German from Greek hypo- "under" + thalamus "an inner chamber, a bedroom, a bed."
- Amygdala: Because of its shape, from Latin amygdala (“almond”), from Ancient Greek ἀμυγδάλη (amugdálē, “almond”).
- Hippocampus: late16th century (denoting a sea horse): via Latin from Greek hippokampos, from hippos ‘horse’ + kampos ‘sea monster’.
- Limbic: Latin limbus, for "border" or "edge"
- Cerebellum: 1560s, from Latin cerebellum "a small brain," diminutive of cerebrum "the brain"
- Cortex: “bark”; 
- Pons: “bridge”; 
- Uncus: “hook,”

### Learning
Concurrent stimulation of climbing fibers and parallel fibers depresses the Purkinje cell responses to subsequent stimulation of the same parallel fibers. This is seen as providing corrective signal from sensory inputs to adjust movement pattern generated by granule-Purkinje cell synapses.

# Methods
## Behavior

## Brain
### Methods of Assessing Brain Anatomy
- CAT: radiation, low spatial resolution
- sMRI: detect different substances, no radiation and good resolution, metal

### Methods of Assessing Brain Physiology
- PET (positron emission tomography): can detect specific substances like neurotransmitters, ionizing radiation (need cyclotron), slow
- MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy): needs large concentration and large region 
- fMRI: good spatial and temporal resolution, available, can be repeated on same person, metal, indirect measurement (metabolic)

### Electromagnetic Recordings
- single cell: difficult on humans
- EEG (electroencephalography): general state of person, non invasive, temporal resolution, can't determine location, can't record activities parallel to surface
- ERP (event related potential): 
- MEG (magnetoencephalography): less affected by tissues in brain so better measurement of location, large set up with shielding room, can't record activities radial to surface

### Optical Imaging
- Slow signal (metabolic)
- Fast signal EROS

### Methods of Modulating Brain Activity
- TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation): treat clinical syndromes
- tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation): less powerful than TMS so more tolerance
