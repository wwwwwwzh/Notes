All things are numbers

Incommensurable: if a and b are any two non-zero rational numbers, then a and b are commensurable; if a is any irrational number and b is any non-zero rational number, then a and b are incommensurable. On the other hand, if both a and b are irrational numbers, then a and b may or may not be commensurable.

 Newton's Arithmetica Universalis (1707): We understand a number not as a set of units, but as the abstract ratio of one magnitude to another magnitude of the same kind taken for that unit.
