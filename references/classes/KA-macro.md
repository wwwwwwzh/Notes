> every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and **by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention**. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.

Economy is to make everyone gets as much as they want. Money/currency is to facilitate this optimization.

Basics
- scarcity: economy concerns allocation of scarce resources 
- normalitive (non-falsifiable) and positive statement
- command (factors of production) and market economy, competition, inequality

- Production possibilities curve: ![](/images/PPF.png)
- (increasing) Opportunity cost
- comparative and absolute advantage, gains from trade, terms of trade

- Law of demand, factors that shift the demand curve (price on y), the curve itself is called demand
- normal and inferior goods (income up -> curve shifts left)
- Law of supply
- Market equilibrium

Economic Indicators
- GDP, GNP (nationals): ![](/images/gdp-circular-flow.png)
- Investment/Business spending (production of new capital equipment by firms, construction of homes) and consumption/Consumer spending (new spending final goods by households except new homes)
- GDP measured by components of demand/spending: GDP=Comsumption+Investment+Government+Net Export
- transfer payments—like unemployment benefits, veteran’s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees—are excluded from GDP
- GDP measured by what is produced
- some data: 77% of US GDP is service, 68% comsumer spending
- US GDP is calculated by Bureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, within the US Department of Commerce
> Note that this GDP measures actually trading instead of production. Imagine a society where everyone lives and advances themselves without trading. GDP would be 0 but production is clearly not. On the other extreme, you can imagine that you have to pay for everything like lifting a cup or going to the bathroom, someone else will take care of those and you in turn will save the time to do something else. Here GDP will match real production. 

- **Unemployment** rate, actively looking
- Natural, cyclical, structural, and frictional unemployment rates

- Inflation, monetary vs price inflation
- **CPI**(-U), U is Urban
- **CII**, core inflation index is a measure of inflation typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables such as food and energy prices
- Deflationary spiral: ![](/images/deflation.png)
- inflation benefits borrower
- Nominal and **real GDP**, GDP deflector, business cycle (expansion and recession/depression)

National Income
- aggregate demand: ![](/images/aggregate-demand.png)
- **MPC** (marginal propensity to consume), total increase in GDP=new money*1/(1-MPC)
- full employment output
- output gap
- **tax mutiplier**
- aggregate supply long and short run
- fiscal policy, govn spending, tax
- contractionary **fiscal policy** (increase tax or decrease spending) decreases demand. expansionary policy. 
- automatic stabilizer (tax, welfare)

Financial Sector
- real (inflation adjusted) and nominal **interest**
- real return in present money

- **bond, stock/share**
- asset - liablity = **equity**
- balance sheet of company: ![](/images/balance-sheet.png)

- functions of money 1) medium of exchange 2) store of money 3) unit of value 4) standard of deferred payment
- commodity and fiat money. dollar: ![](/images/usd-1.png)![](/images/usd-2.png)
- hyperinflation

- central bank and fractional reserve banking (currently 0), decheckable deposit
- banks can lend all of **savings account** savings (because ppl won't ask for it) and part of (Reserve Ratio) **checkings account** savings
- M0/MB, M1, M2: ![](/images/m1.png)
- FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), Full reserve banking
- Bank balance sheet

Money Market
> Note that even though bond price drives dollar price, bonds are not currency since their price fluctuate dramatically and liquidity is low. Both bond and us dollar can be considered investment and commodity though. When considered commodity, bond and dollar are competitors.
- ![](/images/money-market.png)
- ![](/images/influence-of-money-market.png)
> Note that demand and supply for money can be thought of as how much money you want from bank and how much you want to give to bank. Alternatively, you can think of them in terms of if you want to exchange dollar for bond, eg, if you want bond over dollar then it's low demand and high supply for dollar.
- monetary policy (controls money supply)
    - open market operation (buy bond and security, reserve ratio)
    - discount rate
    - federal funds rate
- fiscal policy: tax and debt (controls money demand by directly buying commodity)
- deficit and debt
- pros and cons of running deficit

- Loanable funds
- public saving + priivate saving = national savining = investments = GDP - consumer spending - government spending

- Phillips curve (inverse inflation and unemployment)
- stagnation (high inflation high unemployment)

- Velocity of money (how many times money switched hands in a year)
- Money supply x velocity = price level x real GDP = GDP
- Thus change in Money supply or velocity alone doesn't necessarily change GDP

- moderate inflation in good economy: ![](/images/good-economy-cycle.png)

international trade and finance
- ![](/images/balance-of-payments.png)

- exchange rate
- since currency is unit of value, the supply and demand for a currency is an indicator of the value underlying the country, but it's also mostly just market moves
- countries can print money to buy a foreign currency to reduce exchange rate and create a foreign currency reserve, which can be used to increase exchange rate
- speculative currency attack, Thailand currency crisis
