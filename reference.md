- $\frac{d}{d\omega} F(\omega) = -i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} t f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \,$ which is Fourier transform of -itf(t), ie: $\frac{d}{d\omega} F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}\{ -i t f(t) \}$

## *Transforms in Engineering
### Window Function
- a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval.
- The reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra
- Hann window
- Gaussian window

### Windowed Fourier Transform
Definition:
- Forward: ${\displaystyle \mathbf {STFT} \{x(t)\}(\tau ,\omega )\equiv X(\tau ,\omega )=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }x(t)w(t-\tau )e^{-i\omega t}\,dt}$
- Inverse: 
### Wavelet Transform
Definition:
- ${\displaystyle X_{w}(a,b)={\frac {1}{|a|^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }x(t){\overline {\psi }}\left({\frac {t-b}{a}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} t}$
- a is scale, b is translation, so a essentially represents frequency (1/f). 
- if $\psi = e^{\frac{it}{a}}$ then it's basically the same as fourier transform.
- psi is called the mother wavelet and the scaled and translated versions are daughter wavelets
- Inverse: ${\displaystyle x(t)=C_{\psi }^{-1}\int _{0}^{\infty }\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }X_{w}(a,b){\frac {1}{|a|^{1/2}}}{\tilde {\psi }}\left({\frac {t-b}{a}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} b\ {\frac {\mathrm {d} a}{a^{2}}}}$
- inverse is beyond understanding for now

### Determinant
Definition:

History:
- A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations. 
- Given: $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\x_2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}y_1 \\y_2\end{pmatrix}$, $x_2 = \frac{y_1 - \frac{a}{c} y_2}{b - \frac{a d}{c}}$ and has solution when $b - \frac{a d}{c} \neq 0$ or when ad=cb

Properties:
- if ad=cb, $x_2 = \frac{y_1 - \frac{a}{c} y_2}{b - \frac{a d}{c}}$ is undefined unless y1=y2=0, in which case any x can be anything.

# Statistics and Probability

## Measure Theory
- [intuitive intro](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/measure_theory_3/)
- [definition based posts](https://random-walks.org/intro.html)
### General Definitions
- $\sigma$-algebra:
a collection of subsets of a given set that satisfies the following properties:
    1. Contains the empty set
    2. Closure under complement
    3. Closure under countable unions
    - This also implies closure under set intersections, differences, and symmetric differences

- Measure $\mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty]$
    1. $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
    2. $\mu\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n)$
- Measurable Space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$
- Measure Space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$
- Measurable Function: Given measurable spaces $(F, \mathcal{F})$ and $(H, \mathcal{H})$ a function f: F->H is a measurable function iff $\forall A \in \mathcal{H}, f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{F}$, note that $f^{-1}(A) = \{ f^{-1}(y) \mid y \in A \}$
- Simple function: 
- Lebesgue integral: For the Lebesgue integral, a rectangle is formed for each value in the functionâ€™s codomain

### Probability Measure
- Outcome space:
- Event space (sigma-algebra of outcome space)
- A probability space $(\Omega, E, P)$ is a measure space where $P(\Omega)=1$
- Random variable: 
    - $X: \Omega \to R$. As a measurable function $\forall A \in \mathcal{R}, X^{-1}(A) \in E$.
    - ${\displaystyle P(X=a):=P(X^{-1}(\{a\}))=P(e)=P(w|X(w)=a)}$ for example: ${\displaystyle P(score>60)=P\{X^{-1}((60, 100])\}=P(w|60<X(w)<=100)}$
- Probability mass function: ${\displaystyle p_{X}(x)=P(X=x)}$
- Probability density function:
    - s
- Expectation: $E(X) := \int_{\Omega} X \ dP$


## Common Techniques
### Basic Transformations
Normalization:

Whitening:
- https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/examples/timeseries/whiten/

### Source/Latent Separation
There are source S=[s1(t), s2(t), ...], and observaton X=[x1(t), x2(t), ...]. X=AS. Now you want S from X. S=BX, you want B which is inverse of A.

**PCA**:
principal components constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. PCA-based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss. Maximizes variance (second-order statistics)
- [PCA visual](https://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/)

**ICA**: Minimization of mutual information and Maximization of non-Gaussianity (higher-order statistics)
- [ICA very comprehensive and semi rigorous tutorial paper](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/courses/Stat161-261-Spring14/HyvO00-icatut.pdf): want to find independent components->want non-gaussian sources->opitmize non-gaussianity with kurtosis and negentropy

### ANOVA

### Detection Theory
Sensitivity index (d'):
- separation between means: ${d'={\frac {\left\vert \mu _{a}-\mu _{b}\right\vert }{\sigma }}}$
- measures a participant's ability to distinguish between the presence (signal) and absence (noise) of a stimulus. d' = Z(hit rate) - Z(false alarm rate) where Z means z-score for the probability. A higher d' means better sensitivity

Criterion score (d):
- c = -0.5 Ã— [Z(hit rate) + Z(false alarm rate)]
- c measures the participant's decision threshold or biasâ€”how likely they are to say "Yes, the signal is present" regardless of whether it's actually there.
- A low criterion means they are liberal and tend to say "Yes" more often, leading to more hits but also more false alarms.

## Probability Theory
### Moments
- Raw moment about c: ${\displaystyle \mu _{n}=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }(x-c)^{n}\,f(x)\,\mathrm {d} x.}$
- Central moment: ${\displaystyle \mu _{n}= {E} \left[(X- {E} [X])^{n}\right]=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }(x-\mu )^{n}f(x)\,\mathrm {d} x.}$
- Normalized/standard moment (n-th central moment divided by Ïƒ^n): ${\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{n}}{\sigma ^{n}}}={\frac { {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{n}\right]}{\sigma ^{n}}}={\frac { {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{n}\right]}{ {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]^{\frac {n}{2}}}}.}$

Common moments:
- Mean mu: first raw moment
- Variance: second central moment
- Skewness gamma: standardized third central moment. Left skewed distributions (the tail of the distribution is longer on the left) will have a negative skewness.
- Kurtosis kapa: standardized fourth central moment. measure of the heaviness of the tail

### Characteristic Function
- ${\displaystyle \phi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{itX}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{itx} f_X(x) \, dx}$

Expectation: 
- ${\displaystyle \frac{d\phi_X(t)}{dt} = i\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} xe^{itx} f_X(x) \, dx}$
- ${\displaystyle \frac{d\phi_X(0)}{dt} = i\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f_X(x) \, dx=iE[X]}$ 
- Note that since X is real valued, its fourier transform is conjugate symmetric, so the derivative at 0 is 0 for real component, but there's a shift in phase if derivative is non 0 in complex axis, the shift corresponds to the shift of center of mass of the distribution, ie, expectation.

Variance: 
- $\frac{d^2\phi_X(t)}{dt^2} = -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2e^{itx} f_X(x) \, dx$
- $\frac{d^2\phi_X(0)}{dt^2} = -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 f_X(x) dx=-E[X^2]$
- $\text{Var}(X) = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2$
- The second derivative is a non positive real number. When it's 0, the original distribution is delta, and it's fourier transform is 1, which has all derivatives 0. The more negative it is, the more spiky the transform/power at 0.

In general: $\frac{d^k\phi_X(0)}{dt^k} = i^kE[X^k]$

- Relating to general FT, $\frac{d}{d\omega} F(\omega) = -i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} t f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \,$ which is Fourier transform of -itf(t), ie: $\frac{d}{d\omega} F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}\{ -i t f(t) \}$

Taylor expansion: 
- $\phi(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) e^{ikx} \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \left( 1 + ikx - \frac{k^2x^2}{2} + \dots \right)= 1 + ik \mathbb{E}[x] - \frac{k^2}{2} \mathbb{E}[x^2] + \dots$
- Intuition: from one perspective, if you don't know about the concept of mean or variance etc, Taylor of Fourier of distribution gives approximation of the distribution. Taylor is local. Fourier encodes frequency. So Taylor of Fourier near 0 is good at low frequency. 

### Moment Generating Function (MGF)
Definition:
- $M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{tx} f_X(x) \, dx$
- cf: $\phi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{itX}]$. 
- Relation to CF: M(it)=phi(t) or $M_X(t) = \phi_X(-it)$

Property:
- Generating moments: $\frac{d^n M_X(t)}{dt^n} \bigg|_{t=0} = \mathbb{E}[X^n]$
- Sum of RVs: since convolution becomes multiplication after Fourier transform, summing RVs becomes multiplication of their MGFs. $M_{S_n}(t) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{t S_n}\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{t \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}\right].$
- Normal distribution: $f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}.$ -> $M_X(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{tx} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \, dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 2tx)} \, dx = \frac{e^{\frac{t^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{(x - t)^2}{2}} \, dx.$  The thing inside the integral is gaussian. So $M_X(t) = e^{\frac{t^2}{2}}.$

Taylor: 
- $M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}\left[ e^{tX} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ 1 + tX + \frac{t^2 X^2}{2!} + \frac{t^3 X^3}{3!} + \cdots \right]$

CLT:
- Let $Y_i = \frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma}$, $S_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$
- $M_{S_n}(t) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{t S_n}\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{t}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i}\right]=\left( \mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{t}{\sqrt{n}} Y_1}\right] \right)^n = \left( M_{Y_1}\left( \frac{t}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \right)^n.$
- $M_{Y_1}\left( \frac{t}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \approx 1 + \frac{t^2}{2n} + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right).$
- $M_{S_n}(t) = \left( 1 + \frac{t^2}{2n} + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^n$. Note this crucial step where the higher order moments/higher frequency components of the original distribution, no matter what it is, diminish under the n exponential.
- $\left( 1 + \frac{t^2}{2n} \right)^n \approx \exp\left( \frac{t^2}{2} \right) \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.$

# Health
## Top Hat
- VO2max: maximum liter of O2 per minute
- Aerobic vs anaerobic: Fats, carbohydrates and proteins can be used for fuel during aerobic metabolism; only carbohydrates in anaerobic and without oxygen
- \>=5days/week of moderate intensity exercise for 30m/d for an accumulated total of 150 minutes or more of exercise per week
- moderate intensity exercises are estimated at 50-70% of your Max Heart Rate
- 3 or more days per week of vigorous intensity exercise for 20+ minutes per day for an accumulated total of 75 minutes or more of exercise per week
- vigorous intensity exercises are estimated at 70-85% of your Max Heart Rate

### Nutrition
- 45-65% of daily calories from carbohydrates, 25-35% of daily calories from fat, with <10% from saturated fat and 10%â€“35% of calories from protein.
- Carbohydrates are classified as sugar, starch and fiber. **Sugar** is a type of simple carbohydrate, which is digested rapidly and causes a surge of energy, followed by a crash once metabolized.  **Starches** are complex carbohydrates which take the body longer to break down and therefore provide a more sustained amount of energy and donâ€™t cause a crash. Common examples are whole-grain bread, legumes and food high in fiber. Fiber is a crucial type of carbohydrate as it canâ€™t be digested fully and therefore helps to maintain intestinal health.
- In general, it is best to limit consumption of simple carbohydrates and opt for complex carbohydrates and fiber when possible.
- Healthy fats are typically unsaturated and include nuts, seeds, some types of fish, walnuts and peanut butter. Fats with less health benefits often have large amounts of saturated fats and include butter, ice cream, and some red meat
- 45g grams of protein perday
- adequate intake of 2,700 ml/day for young women (ages 19-30) and 3,700 ml/day for young men (ages 19-30) which is about 11-15 cups per day.

## General Notes
### Book Notes
CS229:
- h is the hypothesis, or our approximate function
- Î¸ is parameter 
- J is cost function. eg MSE: ${J(\theta)=1/2\sum_{i}{(\theta^Tx_i-y_i)^2}}$
- linear model: $h(x)=\theta^Tx$
- LMS update: ${\theta_j:=\theta_j+\alpha(y^i-h_{\theta}(x^i))x_j^i}$
- superscript is sample number usually i from 0 to d; subscript is data dimension also i from 0 to n

### Representation
- [linear representation hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658): high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space
- [UNIVERSAL NEURONS IN GPT2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12181): 
    - 1-5% of neurons are universal. they usually have clear interpretations. deactivating attention heads, changing the entropy of the next token distribution, and predicting the next token to(not) be within a particular set. 
    - Olah et al. (2020b) propose three speculative claims regarding the interpretation of artificial neural networks: that featuresâ€”directions in activation space representing properites of the inputâ€”are the fundamental unit of analysis, that features are connected into circuits via network weights, and that features and circuits are universal across model
    - semantic features neurons corresponding to coherent topics (Lim and Lauw, 2023), concepts (Elhage et al., 2022a), or contexts (Gurnee et al., 2023).
