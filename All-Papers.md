- [ROME]: 1) Causal Tracing of Factual Associations. "we posit a specific mechanism for storage of factual associations: each mid-layer MLP module accepts inputs that encode a subject, then produces outputs that recall memorized properties about that subject. Middle layer MLP outputs accumulate information, then the summed information is copied to the last token by attention at high layers." 2) Intervention by updating W as Key-Value storage approximation

- [Attractor](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Attractor_network): Stable, persistent activity has been thought to be important for neural computation at least since Hebb (1949). Amit (1989), following work on attractors in artificial neural networks, suggested that persistent neural activity in biological networks is a result of dynamical attractors in the state space of recurrent biological networks.

- https://news.mit.edu/2017/neuroscientists-discover-brain-circuit-retrieving-memories-0817: Summary: recalling a memory requires subiculum, formation requires CA1. Experiment: In one group of mice, inhibited neurons of the subiculum as the mice underwent fear conditioning, can recall. In another group, inhibited subiculum neurons after fear conditioning had occurred, cannot recall. Other experiments revealed that the direct circuit from CA1 to the entorhinal cortex is not necessary for memory recall, but is required for memory formation.
- https://news.mit.edu/2017/neuroscientists-identify-brain-circuit-necessary-memory-formation-0406: memories are stored in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. However, the engram cells in the prefrontal cortex were “silent”. When prefrontal engram becomes active, hippocampal engram cells became silent. However, reactivating those cells with light still prompted the animals to freeze. In the basolateral amygdala, once memories were formed, the engram cells remained unchanged. Others: Kitamura says he believes that some trace of memory may stay in the hippocampus indefinitely, storing details that are retrieved only occasionally. “To discriminate two similar episodes, this silent engram may reactivate and people can retrieve the detailed episodic memory, even at very remote time points,” he says.
- https://news.mit.edu/2017/neuroscientists-build-case-new-theory-memory-formation-1023: Summary: plasticity, while necessary for a memory to be initially encoded, is not necessary for its subsequent long-term storage. Experiment: fear conditioning on mice; inhibited the synthesis of cellular proteins immediately after the training; can't recall with natural cues, can be reactivated artificially; treating the mice with PAK1 was enough to grow new synapses between engram cells and can recall naturally after days.
