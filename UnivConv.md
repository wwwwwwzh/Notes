- system has to be complex, a stone for example can't develop this feature
- evolution optimizes for survival advantage
- survival advantage in practice is the ability to solve specific problems better
- transmission of information and improvement of it is a survival advantage
- the ABILITY to create language (the hardware) is therefore a survival advantage
- thus the language system optimizes for various problem solving skills

Why all cultures develop similar concepts, and why all systems categorize similar categories
- when we see things, we identify visually, without any language ability here, categories like apple or trunk or leaf. But we don't categorize things like a point on a trunk combined with a line on an apple. The former is useful in terms of offering better problem solving procedures. That is, certain problem solvings REQUIRE such categorization




Notes
- Something important to always keep in mind is that the convergence is not guarrenteed. It's a statistical law instead of deterministic. A model might not learn a feature, so does human. 


Applications
- It's important that models should develop a language to explain itself. Just like humans convert thoughts to language and communicate with language. Currently, LLMs can explain itself in terms of direct input output relationship, ie, it learned to respond correctly to the concept of "explain" and even "internal thought". The next step is to enable multimodal NN to do this. This needs a large corpus of data that correlate physical phenommena recorded in video or audio with language. Or it might be possible to let networks develop their own language by necessitating commmunication directly btw models.
