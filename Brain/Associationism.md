## Associationism as a Theory of Learning
John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690/1975).[3] 

The first serious attempt to detail associationism as a theory of learning was given by Hume in the Treatise of Human Nature (1738/1975).[4] Hume’s associationism was, first and foremost, a theory connecting how perceptions (“Impressions”) determined trains of thought (successions of “Ideas”). Hume’s empiricism, as enshrined in the Copy Principle,[5] demanded that there were no Ideas in the mind that were not first given in experience.

if two contents of experiences, X and Y, instantiate some associative relation, R, then those contents will become associated, so that future activations of X will tend to bring about activations of Y. The associationist then has to explain what relation R amounts to. The Humean form of associative learning (where R is equated with cause and effect, contiguity, or resemblance) has been hugely influential

Ivan Pavlov

Edward Thorndike’s research with cats in puzzle boxes broadened the theory of associative learning by introducing the notion of consequences to associative learning. the cats’ behaviors were shaped by the consequences that they brought on. This new view of learning, operant conditioning (for the organism is “operating” on its environment), was not merely the passive learning of Pavlov, but a species-nonspecific, general, active theory of learning.

Thorndike’s famous “Law of Effect” (1911), the first canonical psychological law of associationist learning

Thorndike’s paradigm was popularized and extended by B.F. Skinner (see, e.g., Skinner 1953) who stressed the notion not just of consequences but of reinforcement as the basis of forming associations.

what all varieties should share with their historical predecessors is that associative learning is supposed to mirror the contingencies in the world without adding additional structure to them

## Associationism as a Theory of Mental Structure
saying that two concepts are associated amounts to saying that there is a reliable, psychologically basic causal relation that holds between them—the activation of one of the concepts causes the activation of the other.

## Associative Transitions
Associative transitions are movements between thoughts that are not predicated on a prior logical relationship between the elements of the thoughts that one connects. In this sense, associative transitions are contrasted with computational transitions as analyzed by the Computational Theory of Mind

Associative transitions tend to move across different content domains, whereas inferential transitions tend to stay on a more focused set of contents. These differences have been seen to result in measurable differences in mood: associative thinking across topics bolsters mood when compared to logical thinking on a single topic (Mason and Bar 2012).

## Associative Instantiation
The most well-known associative instantiation base is a class of networks called Connectionist networks

Connectionists have often been followers of the Skinnerian anti-representationalist tradition (Skinner 1938). Because of the distributed nature of the nodes in connectionist networks, the networks have tended to be analyzed as associative stimulus/response chains of subsymbolic elements. However, the question of whether connectionist networks have representations which are distributed in patterns of activity throughout different nodes of the network, or whether connectionist networks are best understood as containing no representational structures at all, is orthogonal to both the question of whether the networks are purely associative or computational, and whether the networks can implement classical architectures.

## Associationism in Social Psychology
### Implicit Attitudes
Implicit attitudes are generally operationally defined as the attitudes tested on implicit tests such as the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al. 1998), the Affect Misattribution Procedure (Payne et al. 2005), the Sorted Paired Feature Task (Bar-Annan et al. 2009) and the Go/No-Go Association Task (Nosek and Banaji 2001).

De Houwer and his collaborators have taken to show that associative learning is, at base, relational, propositional contingency learning; i.e., that all putatively associative learning is in fact a nonautomatic learning process that generates and evaluates propositional hypotheses (Mitchell et al. 2009; De Houwer 2009, 2011, 2014 2019; Hughes et al. 2019).

one might demonstrate that learning through merely reading an evaluative statement creates a stronger implicit attitude than repeated associative exposures (Kurdi and Banaji 2017, 2019; Mann et al. 2019).

Mandelbaum (2016) argued that logical/evidential interventions modulate implicit attitudes in predictable ways (e.g., using double negation to cancel each other out), while others have used diagnosticity to show that implicit attitudes update in a non-associationistic, propositional way (e.g., after reading a story about a man who broke into a building and appeared to ransack it you learn that we jumped into save people from a fire and immediately change your opinion of the man from negative to positive; Mann and Ferguson 2015; Mann et al. 2017; Van Dessel et al. 2019). (For more on implicit attitudes see the entry on implicit bias).

## Dual Process
The dual-process strain most relevant to the current discussion posits two systems, one evolutionarily ancient intuitive system underlying unconscious, automatic, fast, parallel and associative processing, the other an evolutionarily recent reflective system characterized by conscious, controlled, slow, “rule-governed” serial processes (see, e.g., Evans and Stanovich 2013).

### Is Neural Network Associative 
When you have a network, what it does is given inputs give outputs. Or that it's simply a function. A function "maps" things and is by definition associative.
