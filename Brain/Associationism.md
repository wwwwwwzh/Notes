## Associationism as a Theory of Learning
John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690/1975).[3] 

The first serious attempt to detail associationism as a theory of learning was given by Hume in the Treatise of Human Nature (1738/1975).[4] Hume’s associationism was, first and foremost, a theory connecting how perceptions (“Impressions”) determined trains of thought (successions of “Ideas”). Hume’s empiricism, as enshrined in the Copy Principle,[5] demanded that there were no Ideas in the mind that were not first given in experience.

if two contents of experiences, X and Y, instantiate some associative relation, R, then those contents will become associated, so that future activations of X will tend to bring about activations of Y. The associationist then has to explain what relation R amounts to. The Humean form of associative learning (where R is equated with cause and effect, contiguity, or resemblance) has been hugely influential

Ivan Pavlov

Edward Thorndike’s research with cats in puzzle boxes broadened the theory of associative learning by introducing the notion of consequences to associative learning. the cats’ behaviors were shaped by the consequences that they brought on. This new view of learning, operant conditioning (for the organism is “operating” on its environment), was not merely the passive learning of Pavlov, but a species-nonspecific, general, active theory of learning.

Thorndike’s famous “Law of Effect” (1911), the first canonical psychological law of associationist learning

Thorndike’s paradigm was popularized and extended by B.F. Skinner (see, e.g., Skinner 1953) who stressed the notion not just of consequences but of reinforcement as the basis of forming associations.

what all varieties should share with their historical predecessors is that associative learning is supposed to mirror the contingencies in the world without adding additional structure to them

## Associationism as a Theory of Mental Structure
saying that two concepts are associated amounts to saying that there is a reliable, psychologically basic causal relation that holds between them—the activation of one of the concepts causes the activation of the other.

### Relation Between Associative Learning and Associative Structures

## Associative Transitions
Associative transitions are movements between thoughts that are not predicated on a prior logical relationship between the elements of the thoughts that one connects. In this sense, associative transitions are contrasted with computational transitions as analyzed by the Computational Theory of Mind

Associative transitions tend to move across different content domains, whereas inferential transitions tend to stay on a more focused set of contents. These differences have been seen to result in measurable differences in mood: associative thinking across topics bolsters mood when compared to logical thinking on a single topic (Mason and Bar 2012).

## Associative Instantiation
The most well-known associative instantiation base is a class of networks called Connectionist networks

Connectionists have often been followers of the Skinnerian anti-representationalist tradition (Skinner 1938). Because of the distributed nature of the nodes in connectionist networks, the networks have tended to be analyzed as associative stimulus/response chains of subsymbolic elements. However, the question of whether connectionist networks have representations which are distributed in patterns of activity throughout different nodes of the network, or whether connectionist networks are best understood as containing no representational structures at all, is orthogonal to both the question of whether the networks are purely associative or computational, and whether the networks can implement classical architectures.

## Associationism in Social Psychology
### Implicit Attitudes
Implicit attitudes are generally operationally defined as the attitudes tested on implicit tests such as the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al. 1998), the Affect Misattribution Procedure (Payne et al. 2005), the Sorted Paired Feature Task (Bar-Annan et al. 2009) and the Go/No-Go Association Task (Nosek and Banaji 2001).

De Houwer and his collaborators have taken to show that associative learning is, at base, relational, propositional contingency learning; i.e., that all putatively associative learning is in fact a nonautomatic learning process that generates and evaluates propositional hypotheses (Mitchell et al. 2009; De Houwer 2009, 2011, 2014 2019; Hughes et al. 2019).

one might demonstrate that learning through merely reading an evaluative statement creates a stronger implicit attitude than repeated associative exposures (Kurdi and Banaji 2017, 2019; Mann et al. 2019).

Mandelbaum (2016) argued that logical/evidential interventions modulate implicit attitudes in predictable ways (e.g., using double negation to cancel each other out), while others have used diagnosticity to show that implicit attitudes update in a non-associationistic, propositional way (e.g., after reading a story about a man who broke into a building and appeared to ransack it you learn that we jumped into save people from a fire and immediately change your opinion of the man from negative to positive; Mann and Ferguson 2015; Mann et al. 2017; Van Dessel et al. 2019). (For more on implicit attitudes see the entry on implicit bias).

## Dual Process
The dual-process strain most relevant to the current discussion posits two systems, one evolutionarily ancient intuitive system underlying unconscious, automatic, fast, parallel and associative processing, the other an evolutionarily recent reflective system characterized by conscious, controlled, slow, “rule-governed” serial processes (see, e.g., Evans and Stanovich 2013).

# Associationism Neural Explanations
### Overview
Assume initial connection strength are random, then neurons close to each other will be activated more often. An input with one modality activate neurons near its sensory organ. All those neurons activated initially form connections between each other and propagates to nearby regions and gradually diminish. They cannot reach other primary sensory cortex by themselves. 

When an input involves two modalities, two propagations are initiated and have a chance of meeting, forming some connections. Now these only apply to concrete things we can sense, like the view of a specific apple or sound of "apple". How do we understand general ideas like cat that could eventually help connect infinite cat like things to one idea of cat? When we see two cats, we have two different activations near V1, but some activations must be similar, and will be similar across many cats, either because of evolutionary basic visual discrimination circuits or because of probability. When we see different cats and people say they are cats, two groups of activations remain the same, one for the similar across cats part of V1 and one for A1. By repeated exposure, these invariant parts are connected while the non critical part of image of cat are not since their activations fluctuate and might cancel out. 

Now we can also categorize unknown things within modality, e.g. know the kinds of faces without corresponding them to any other modality like language describing them or emotion. This requires a purely internal modality (See below Hidden Neurons). In principle, faces with very different looks activate a more different set of neurons than those sharing more similarities. By repeated exposure, similar faces will be grouped together by a certain set of neurons that always activate by these faces. 

### Hidden Neurons
The consciousness we can concretely feel, the so called access consciousness, are the major senses we have, visual, auditory, tactile, etc. 

We also "think" mostly in these senses. Mostly, it's a loop of auditory memory, namely language. 

Sometimes we have vague ideas, but most of them can still be identified with a particular sense. When I cannot recall a word, I'm still trying with characters and that word has a vague representation. This might be related to the infinite memory/representation idea, specifically the deponent representation where out of scope inputs give output that's only partially recognizable.

However, there are conscious ideas that are very vague and cannot seem to be categorized into external senses. One hypothesis is that there is a conscious organ, like that responsible for vision or inner speech, that processes brain consciousness. That is, it senses activities within the brain. The idea from this modality cannot be retrieved as images or words because it's neither but it can be recalled and manipulated just as in other modalities and can also be partially converted to other modalities. Hippocampus might be related to this rule.

## Episodic Memory

## Abstract Connection (Theory of Form)

### Remember Similar Things
If I'm given many words with similar pronounciations, I cannot remember them without using linguistic techniques. But if I'm given a whole lecture I can capture many similar ideas. This might be a consequence of probability since confict of neurons connecting two modalities is magnitude rarer than within modality. A counter example is potato tomato.

### Termination and Consciousness by Mass Hypothesis
In the question regarding infinite memory, it was discussed that if a network is just like a ANN, then the output space is infinite, leading to infinite unseen memory/consciousness. 

A problem with ANN is that input and output are through a unidirectional network while in brain every modality is connected to each other bidirectionally. 

Another difference is that real networks diminishes. Any stimuli gradually decrease before reaching another modality, meaning that normally it can't activate anything in "output" modality (In ANN this can be controlled by weight initialization, so can real network). Here comes the Mass hypothesis which states that in a group of neurons we can consciously access, the percentage of activation must be above threshold. Otherwise we feel nothing or extremely vague ideas that hardly constitute consciousness.

Only by learning will a pathway be established st enough activation will be seen in the other end of propagation. 

This is also to be understood with attention. Attention is either top-down st an attention modality selects a modality to be conscious, or bottom-up st the most active modality automatically become conscious and center of attention.

### Universal Consciousness
Based on mass hypothesis, we can further hypothesize that every neuron in brain is consciously accessible, but to induce consciousness they have to be a lot and together. This will eliminate the need for hidden neurons since every neuron is both first input and final output. 

## Long Short Term Memory
Memory doesn't go away. Given a group of activations at shallow layer, they are quickly flushed out by constant incoming stimuli. The deeper they go and the more diverse modalities they contain, the less likely they will be flushed out by new random inputs. 

Short term: when about to say thank you and someone said that in front of me, I will copy their tone. This might be that the other person's voice input overwhelmed my toning module and since both my plan of tone and their tone quickly flush through, none has a lasting effect. 

Long term: 
## Thought
### Flow of Thought

### Random Thoughts
Sometimes whether by explicit query or out of nowhere, a thought, auditory or visual or other will emerge. 
## Dream
### Observations
1. Dream is mostly episodic, meaning it's like pieces of events with rich visual and auditory stimuli instead of abstract thinking. (Sometimes during a nap, it's also possible to have linguistic dream where you thought you were awake and were thinking about normal things)
2. Dream transition can be illogical and abrupt.
3. Interactions with characters in dream are based on people in real life we have interacted with the most.
4. Consciousness is low in dream, and increases gradually. Highest level might happen when being anxious or excited. Consciousness might thus mean number of neurons we have access to. e.g. when you are drowsy but you start talking suddenly you are sober.
5. Dream senses are different from normal senses in that they do resemble memory of senses more than actually conscious feeling of sensing.

### Questions
- If we imagine something unphysical, we are good, just like in dream. But if we see something unphysical, we are surprised. Which part of brain is in charge of the reality check/nonsense suppression? (Can this be based on what you know is only from what you see?)

### Hypothesis
Assumptions:
1. Abstract thinking is harder or less natural than episodic thinking than episodic recall/imagination

Based on these here is a hypothesis on how dreams work: 
1. People start any episodic thinking
2. This sometimes leads to abstract thinking and can prevent sleep.
3. Episodic thinking becomes more realistic until no abstract thinking naturally arises.
4. The episode unfolds naturally as a consequence of association weights
5. Unfolding of episodic memory might lead to physiological changes that underlie both sleep and daydreaming and meditation.

### Abruptness of Dream
Real life is as abrupt as dreams. When we rotate our heads we don't have smooth transitions, we just see one scene jumps to another. We also have sudden change of states. When we are extremely drowsy in class the whole world looks different than when we suddenly hear the class over and get up sober. Also when watching movies, we don't notice transitions at all. When one scene ends we don't expect the camera to hold or follow to next day or year and show next scene, it just transits, nothing unusual.

### Papers
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3384570/: female recall > male; right hander > mix/left
- [Dreams and interhemispheric asymmetry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11811128/): the left hemisphere seems to provide dream origin while the right hemisphere provides dream vividness, figurativeness and affective activation level.
## Behavioral
### Confidence
The more connections the given topic you have, the more confident you are. Given the name Napoleon, if you know a lot about him, ideas are quickly activated and you are ready to say many things about him. But if you've never heard of say, Ur, then thinking or hearing about it connects to little, you feel lost and afraid.

### Humor
Unlike happiness or sadness or fear, humor or funniness is hard to pinpoint. Anything that could damage you cause fear, anything that leads to potential survival chance increase makes you happy. But what types of things are funny. 

Expectedness and unexpectedness both seem to sometimes make people laugh, they also make people not laugh. 

## Language
### Overview
When we hear something, we have representations of a sequence of sound. Note that inner speech requires only sound, not speaking ability for normal humans. Thus the ability to hear and even understand things doesn't mean the ability to repeat them or produce similar sounds. There might be wiring facilitated connection between speech producing motor modality and auditory modality. This, by trial and error, helps quickly establish connections between sound and actions to produce that sound. This is by itself unidirectional, from sound to motor plan. But we can almost always hear what we say, thus a backward connection from motor plan to sound is always established.

### Auditory Processing
- Note that we automatically try to produce the sounds we hear, suggesting a strong connection between auditory consciousness and the ability to connect sounds to other modalities like speech motor. If we avoid doing this, sounds become less conscious. For unfamiliar sounds like foreign languages, doing this would lead to lower reproduction rate when repeating. For sounds we can't produce, two case. First we simulate the sound like sound of leaves or frogs. When there's no similar sounded words, we still can remember like sound of waves or music.

### Meaning of Language
- Note that we never connected some nouns to static objects or verbs to actions. I realized that I have no idea what is 胳膊 (arm) other than it's related to arm. Then I realized I can say there's a thing on your arm or arm higher without defining any words within those phrases. It's the whole phrase connected to the whole concept. They don't require inference on the constituting parts.

## Failed Connections
### Similarity Failure

### Overwritten Failure

### Sparse Connection Failure
People confuse left and right because they are very abstract but their use cases are very wide yet strict (mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive+universal usage). It's hard to link specific things to left or right: an apple is left to me is very different than a building next to another. They are also used in widely varying cases: left to, turn left, left part of, etc. Observe that sometimes people use proxy connection like their hands or rotation of their hands to tell leftness.  

## Multimodal Distribution
Since neurons are discrete, they can modal multimodal distriibutions like categorical distributions and there can be many categories.

### Is Neural Network Associative 
When you have a network, what it does is given inputs give outputs. Or that it's simply a function. A function "maps" things and is by definition associative.
