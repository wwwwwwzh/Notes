# Vision
## Pixel Coordinate
Staring at bright light and close eye. Moving head maintains that light's relative position to eye center in the "big black frontal screen". 

If our perception of space is only from retinotopy of various processing centers, i.e. we know something is left to something else because the actual neuron is to the left of another neuron, each corresponding to their respective real world stimulus. 

The origin of retinotopy is retina. So if the previous theory holds true, a receptor on a certain neuron will only give you one coordinate. However, as shown above simply changing eye direction can alter our sense of where it is in space.

gaze centered->head centered->self centered

## 3D Construction
know the world changes when I move, the change is gradual and slow. -> (depth: move behind it and see what is there + see from front but move parallel to it)systematic observation of object

## Retina


## Movement
### Others
The buildings shown in this image is more easily seen when the picture moves, even scaling works.

## Pathway
### Scene Familiarization
It seems that when exploring environments dynamically, both pathways are active. But when statically examining, it's predominantly ventral. But once we get familirized, we concern more about how to deal with objects instead of sensing them.

# Learning
## Building Blocks
### Contrast & Similarity
On a primitive level, contrast exists in all sensual processing. A dark light is perceived differently than a bright light. A sharp pain is different from a slow one. On a higher level, we learned to contrast ideas. For example, we know a circle is different from a square by associating the strait edges with square and the symmetrical curviness with circle. But when we approximate a circle with polygons, it feels natural that a similarity is growing between the two shapes.

### Association

## Things that are there
### Algorithms
Neural circuits are powerful enough to approximate any function and we shouldn't doubt if some function is too complex for biological structures. e.g. pitch differentiation is logarithmic. 

# Language
## General Model
1. Understanding and using language are separate but connected tasks
2. Understanding is auditory input to inner thoughts and using is inner thoughts to language (words and grammar)
## Aphasia
### Observation
- Word cue helps recalling words
- Writing sometimes easier than speaking
- Can't really read
- Seems no problem understanding
- Can recover 
### Literature
- [Impaired reasoning and problem-solving in individuals with language impairment due to aphasia or language delay](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01523/full): language supports complex reasoning 
- [Inner Speech in Aphasia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233112/): inner speech can be preserved relative to spoken language, particularly among those with relatively intact word retrieval and difficulty primarily at the level of speech output processing
- [Numerical skills and aphasia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10217921/): Broca's and Wernicke's aphasics scored similarly at the quantitative level, and amnesic aphasics were less impaired. Interestingly, qualitative analysis of the errors indicated that each group presented with specific difficulties. In simple calculation, multiplication was found to be the most impaired operation, in particular in Broca's aphasics.

### Aphasia and Thought


### Aphasia and Amusia
Maybe aphasia is similar to how I can sing in my mind "in perfect pitch" but not when really sing out loud.

## 

## Notes
### Developmental
- Language is left hemisphere, how did that develop
- We think mostly in language and the level of intelligence we have depends on language. We also have Jill B. Taylor who had consciousness but no specific thinking during her stroke. This means consciousness doesn't depend on language or word thinking. On the other hand, if we loss language related regions we can't think clearly. This raises the next question
- Inner speech and thinking depend on language. Is it incidental that the downstream parts of auditory system takes this job? What's special about sound that makes us truly think? Why do we develop speech before writing? Note that 

### Language & Thought
- Left right hemisphere difference in processing information/thinking, what are biological differences
- https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00005/full: 1) there is left-hemispheric dominance for more basic features of species-typical communicative sounds rather than just human language 2) all aspects suggest left is more detail oriented and right more global (hardmax vs softmax) (bias variance tradeoff)

### Language & Consciousness
- [Scientist with a stroke](https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_my_stroke_of_insight?language=en): 1) can't differentiate the boundary between body and world. consciousness shift outside body (compare Feynman) 2) complete silence, then drift to "La La Land", then hear (think) about the problem in self.

# Sleep
## States and Transitions
### language - vision transition
it appears that sleep begins with closiing eyes, thus cutting off real visual input, meanwhile ccosiiousness is  taken by language/auditory simulations (note that this is purely  language instead of thoughts). Then language gradually give way to visual simulation. One theory is that this process is mediated by memory/sensory simulation, whereby the first phase is dominated by real memory, which for me focuses on conversations. There is an interesting interphase where real memory gives way to "drowsy memory" (eg consiousness is recalling an event which is fake memory, this can be tested by waking person in this phase up and they will realize the memory is out of no where). There's a blending between memory and simulation happening as I get more asleep, whiich  could support the imaginatioin as future memory hypothsis. Asleep is marked by complete visual consciiousness and complete imagination.

# Memory
## Fundamental Theorem?
1. All memory results from association i.e. adjustment of synaptic strength between neurons
2. Memory strength is a function of time and initial strength. -> (23.11.4) Memory strength changes whenever new stimuli comes in.
3. Each association has its own strength function (doesn't need to naturally decline)
3.5. Association and dissociation are the same?

## Memory and Attention

## Dream Memory
### Types of Memory
- 2 axis
- axis 1: belief about type of memory (dream, predream, awake)
- axis 2: under what state is the memory recalled (dream, predream, awake)


## Others
Also see Advanced AI and Brain under ![](/Logs.md)

### Face Similar But Can't Recall
Someone looks familiar but can't remember who he resembles whatsoever until you see that person and suddenly knows that's the one you are looking for. Might be related to unidirection and central theorem two

### Finally Recall Things Wasn't Able to be Recalled
When seeing a face we think it's familiar but can't recall exactly why it's familiar. When seeing a seemingly familiar scene we can't recall where exactly it is. Sometimes we have vague memory traces, so vague that not a single complete scene nor plot nor character could be recalled, but you know it is there. Then after sometime, maybe a long time, you see that face or movie again and you will immediately know that's the one you were looking for.

### Forgetting after certain not forgetable
might be repeated activation but after seeing it stops exciting

### What counts as rememberiing
what happens when you say you can't remember someone's face waht's the differentce when you can remembre

# Representation
##
### 
You can manipulate a mental representaion and feel its change. For example, search tensegrity and at first you might believe this structuere is unstable. Concretely, if you nudge the mental represetnaion of this in your brain, it collapses. However, after some study of the structure, nudge it again and you can feel the structure turned more stable in just minutes. 

# Exectutive 
## Uncertainty
- when doing or thinking something, like adding two numbers or walking, sometimes when the  result is uncertain, you can feel something. If you give the result of addition very fast you feel something not good.

## 
### Perception of Scale
how do we think about a transaction of 10 dollars when we have 100 and how do we think about 10 million when we have 100 million. How does this relate to rythms of brain and recognition of places. Is grid cell like representation ubiquous in brain?

# Consciousness
## Uninspectability
It's rare that peopple can consciously perform an activity while consciously inspecting themselves. IIt's also interesting to see how time relates to consciousess since information at different parts of brain reflect events in different time in the past. Does consciousness reside 1ms ago or 1ns ago or is truly part of presence.

## Consiousness study
### Dream 
- using breath pattern to communicate with people running the experiement
- thinking about marker (as in MRI signal) words or images 

## Area of Consciousness
### Motion
- When I was looking for something and didn't find, I "realized" it's in somewhere else, so I rotated my head to that direction. However, I didn't consciously realize. It appears that my motion control independently solved the problem, and that my consciousness followed the movement in order to realize what was happening.

## Observations
### Visual Consciousness
- When we see something, we are processing signals of the past. 
- When we say we are seeing something/something is visually accessible for consciousness, are we conscious of its memory or of "real" present (real at most mean signal as they enter some part of brain since they can't be real time)?
- When we don't pay attention or forgets completely a part of the scene, were we conscious of it? Since we are conscious of the whole, it's reasonable to argue that we must be conscious of all its parts.  
- Example of face. We know two faces are different. Face differentiation is difficult so supposedly there need to be converged feature neurons that help process such messy input data and give order to the structure. But we can't "access" these features. First hypothesis is that these features don't exist and are extremely distributed. So is consciousness neuron specific? (we can only access specific neurons that has high correspondence with physical features/highly linearly dependent of physical world. Contrast with the consciousness by mass hypothesis). Another hypothesis is that these feature neurons have yet to be associated with something we can consciously access. A midway hypothesis is that no matter the hidden features are distributed or not they are all "consciously accessible", but we haven't associated them with those highly convenient accessible consciousness such as language or vision. One scheme or learning is to iteratively associate these fuzzy feelings with words which come with bias. Then next time you see things that should have incurred the feelings you think of the words and the words got associated with the thing you are processing this time, less bias! Much like VQ-VAE learning. But there is another nuance here. You can't invent words to compare two faces easily as you would with big and small things. Some "features" are physically more complex and involve so many non linearities that words become cumbersome and holistic processing prevails. That is probably why we have different networks in two hemispheres. There is an inherent tradeoff between specificity (how detailed and accurately can you describe things) and complexity (how complex the data is). Thus we just have two machines that excel in each. A classical way of solving tradeoffs.
- Example of language. Some people can tell that drei, three and tres are the same thing. Some people can't tell but can learn them easily. Some people treat them as completely different things. (If hidden vectors don't share features, they are far apart. If they do, they are closer. So a well separated clouds of feature space means good feature finding.  )
### Stop of Noise
At the instant of the stop, you remember/are aware of both the noise before stop and the quietness immediately after. But if no such sudden stop happened, you are neither aware of the noise nor will remember the sound of the noise.

### Attention and Consciousness
When we see something, we are aware that we are seeing it, all of it and every part of it. If any part of it changes we can notice it. But if not some parts are never attended to. If someone is holding a red bottle and I'm staring at it while thinking about something else, I might never "know" that the bottle is red. I have to allocate some thinking and ask "what is the color of the bottle" to know the color. When I travel, if no attention is paid whatsoever, I might not remember anything about a particular scene. If I'm relaxing, I'll roughly have a sketch in my mind. So rough that not a single edge is actually in place and not a single color is close. We have some powerful compression mechanism that assigns blue to sky, green to all plants and white to all snow. We have to constantly ask questions and answer them to remember details. But sometimes when it's dramatic, we also remember details of the event and its accompanying scene. Also, every time we look at something we notice something different.

## Hypothesis
### Consciousness and Memory
Memory is actually the only thing we have. The future is imagined with memory and the present is really the past once it "is" the present. Nevertheless, we are conscious of "present" and present only. Maybe it has to do with some fundamental aspect of time. 

## High Level Processing
### Different Ways to "See" Things
[Feynman count with image or sound](https://youtu.be/Si6NbKqYEd8?si=eNuaYrqI1JWTr7hb&t=337)

### Why Do We Need Attention or Focus and Much more Energy When We Are Trying to be Precise
e.g. you have a instant thought that sth is true and have a quick thought and seems like you can prove it. but it takes more time and determination to really pin it done. and you can't do this when you're tired

"We don't understand math, we just get used to it", meaning that the hard math we face when first learning it is hard because of complexity of structure of nature (See universal convergence of natural science, ANN and NN). When we have done many math problems, similar problems are processed unconsciously (passed to a big universal network). We can also imagine someone proficient in science and logic could face new math problems as easily as we face old ones.

### "Working Memory"/Hot Memory
Why we think faster about a topic after an energetic discussion with others and why we can't sleep after talking to friends at night? Everything we do changes the landscape of memory and if the universal processing network that doesn't involve LTP exists, it is constantly changing (imagine two lakes connected only through a stream, one has strong wind and big wave, the other only minimally affected by current from first lake). When we talk about a specific topic, some parts of the lake wave dramatically, influencing the whole lake. Then when we query it, it just gets more efficient at producing insights because different currents have been blended. Similarly, this network with little irrelavent input can quickly turn to relavent stimuli and converge to energy minimal as those strong inputs, so we always imagine some talking after talking for long time. 

# Cerebellum
[man without cerebellum](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/16/392789753/a-man-s-incomplete-brain-reveals-cerebellum-s-role-in-thought-and-emotion)
Research on Jonathan and people like him supports the idea that the cerebellum really has just one job: It takes clumsy actions or functions and makes them more refined. "It doesn't make things. It makes things better," Schmahmann says.

"He doesn't really get into this deeper level of conversation that builds strong relationships, things that would be the foundation for a romantic relationship or deep enduring friendships," she says. Jonathan, who is sitting beside her, says he agrees.

Jonathan also needed to be taught a lot of things that people with a cerebellum learn automatically, Sarah says: how to speak clearly, how to behave in social situations and how to show emotion.
# LLM
## General
### Basics
1. The input tokens can be seen as inputs crudely processed (after primary sensory modality)
2. Cross attention serves several purposes including horizontal connection, hidden variable extraction and 
3. The first layer of FFN serves as keys to second layer which can be seen as memory bank. The nth column of first layer corresponds to the nth row of second. Most heavily connected rows in memory bank contribute more to output.
4. During training, connections are established in backprop

### Cross Attention

### Memory Bank

### Backprop



# Major Questions
- Neural circuits that support episodic memory (hopfield?)
- Initialization of weights and how inputs determine modality (blind people with V1 processing auditory information)
- Levels of intermediate neurons and consciousness. Should we really differentiate "thinking" or "inner speech" and final output/behavior.
- Is perception memory (is memory perception with attention): should perception be regarded as modal specific memory or unconnected memory whereas recall memory stems from either internal or perceptive stimuli and activates connected ideas
- When distant neurons corresponding to originally distant ideas are associated, how does the synapse take short cuts. How does connections outside hippocampus form once hippocampus has done its job.
- Are there really different types of functions of neural circuits? imitation->episodic memory->difference&similarity(pattern)->
Reward vs non reward based learning

## Blueprint
### 10.4
1. The brain can be abstracted as a big network of neurons where each neuron is connected to many other neurons (sparse hopfield where each node is a MLP or transformer)
2. Coactivation of a group of neurons strength the connections of every connections within the group
3. The network is constantly changing while producing output (MLP loop or dynamic hopfield)
4. The first major learning goals are proprioception, visual stimuli as function of time, and interaction between self and the world (discovery of experiment)

# Minor Questions
- Drawing: hand drawing->scribbles->shapes->patterns
- time and place cells in hippocampus. necessary or byproduct
- People say brain learn with few examples. But don't forget how biased we can be: we justify a claim by just one example; we base our judgement for one day on something happening for one minute... In addition, we fail to learn many things with few shots. We can't recognize similar faces at first. We can't easily directly learn a language without grammar background. We have to sometimes infer priors to make sense of observations
- Why concentration and precise language is hard? Does precision require more detail as in visual imagination? I think yes. You first think of something vague, then you its content is used to relate to something more, with more details, then you iteratively add more detail to your description, either visual or linguistic, to obtain something as precise as you want it to be (as away from counter examples)
- Dream, memory, attention, memory of recalling memory, perception vs internal thoughts: when we concentrate on external stimuli, we remember; when we don't concentrate, we don't; when don't remember what we thought about or imagined hours ago; we remember that we did thought or imagined something; we remember trying to recall something either internal or external; we don't really remember dreams without rehearsal; we remember trying to recall a dream. Note that it's easier to remember visual thoughts with "plots" (daydream). However, real dreaming or falling asleep requires giving up voluntary control of the scene and interactions and instead imagine a "static" scene unfold itself.
- Implicit memory is more statistical, it combines large data and get generalizations. Explicit memory is specific and differentiates between details so we can recall things accurately
- Is memory of an emotion reactivating some emotional output or perceptual input to re-elicit that emotion
- high attention in dream seems to lower response to real world perception
- Is RNN equivalent to neuron in terms of temporal and spacial aggregation
- working memory and episodic memory might also be explained as connections within episodes, i.e. between individual detailed features. Thus a hopfield like structure for this kind of memory is likely

# Notes
- look around system: 1. intuitive systems (curiosity, biological needs...) 2. recognize seen objects 3. tell if familiar objects changed 4. tell if objects doesn't conform to mental model 5. physics
- non fixed length attention: each word sequentially generates KVQ. output either start of response or latent (continue to listen)
- sleep spindles actively participate in the consolidation of overnight declarative memory. The density of spindles increase after extensive learning of declarative memory tasks and the degree of increase in stage 2 spindle activity correlates with memory performance.
- cortical and nuclei architechture might be for different purposes (storage vs operation)
- Explicit memory connects specific detail to other specific details that are highly relevant (within the same episode). When it becomes implicit, it can readily be used in thinking and talking without being activated by those specific details.
- dream memory is sometimes real memory but mostly "fake"
- Synesthesia
