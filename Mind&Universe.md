# Evolutional Explanation for Certain Concepts of Human
The universe gave as only measurement of space and time, and senses of various concepts like force, motion, proportionality, circle, etc, that we would develop into ideas or guesses verified by the direct measurement of space and time. The verified ideas we call truth. 

## Fundamental Concepts
### Physics
We invented the notion of length, weight, speed, etc. These notions that we humble human beings made up turned out to be great measurements of the universe and we have since used them with ease to an extent that they ARE the true ideas of the universe as used by the creator himself. 

To study the process by which we invent abstract physical measurement, we first study how we invent any idea at all. I have been using the word "invent" even though some might think "discover" will be a more proper word. Th relationship between the two will be explained later. 

Everything we "know" comes from our senses. I know the existence of my computer because I'm seeing it and typing on it. I know some cold air is flowing from the vent because I hear something typical of a air conditioner. 

Suppose the only activities that mattered to our primitive ancestors were foraging and escaping from predators. What it needs to do to accomplish those tasks and what "ideas" must it develop to facilitate the process? It needs to move. With move comes all classical physics stuffs but let us develop those ideas step by step. This ancestor not only needs to move, but to navigate. If we only have a small set of neurons that control the navigation, what will they be? A distance neuron would be useful because knowing how far away different food sources are preserves energy (One without such neuron go to a distant food source half of the time when facing such decision and is obviously more likely to die). A speed neuron is essential in chasing. Your ancestor wants to be as slow as possible to preserve energy but faster than the predator to survive. 

As discussed, these neurons have to form out of necessity to infer the structure of inputs. So what input necessitate such formation? The most useful sensory organ we have, the eyes, gives us a partial description of the environment at any time frame. A circuit that compares two such descriptions will give us a change in time, more precisely a change in environment as a function of time. A distance neuron can be formed in a simple supervised manner where a visual input corresponds to some homeostatic measure, say level of adrenaline (the connection between adrenaline and visual input itself should be from natural selection). A speed neuron needs forms between calculated change of inputs and a lower level response. 

What matters here is that we developed in our brain intuitively the notion of speed and distance. But what's the relationship between these superficial notions with the universe? When we trace back how these neurons formed, we first see we have the (visual) inputs. The visual inputs come from objects in the universe interacting with light. The objects themselves are "moving" with certain "speed". How can we remove the parenthesis here? We can't. But we have enough evidence, or we have to accept a grand guess, that the objects we see actually exist, that they are actually moving, and that they are moving in certain speeds. That means, even if no humans exist, they are still there. Of course there is no way to prove this, but we accept this guess because it's a good one. It promoted both philosophical and practical advances. 

Now we have accepted that the universe arranges and changes things in a pattern. These patterns then give rise to observations which because they are results of these patterns exist in themselves patterns. When these patterns are projected to our brain, they enter the neurons with patterns and these patterns in inputs necessitate pattern in neurons. The cycle is thus complete: laws of universe manifest themselves everywhere in the universe.

### Gravity, Symmetry, and Circle

### Geometry
The circle is arguably the most miraculous and common geometric object studied and used in human history. But have you ever wondered why people devoted so much time to such a construction, and why did people come up with the idea of a circle in the first place? 

Geometric objects like circle, triangle, or rectangles didn't just pop up glowing in the sky. They come from nature, as every human idea does. Look around you and see how many things have approximately such simple shapes. It's better actually to look outside in nature since that's what they originally came from. The sun is a circle, some stars trace circular orbits, the ripple after a water drop radiates equally in every direction. Circle is everywhere, and we shall see that it's again work of some basic physical laws that produced and thus gave as clues to decipher themselves.

## Math
### "We hold these truths to be self-evident"

### Calculus
> By assuming his laws of motion and gravity as axioms and using his calculus as a deductive instrument, Newton proved that all three of Kepler’s laws followed as logical necessities. The same was true for Galileo’s law of inertia, the isochronism of pendulums, the odd number rule for balls rolling down ramps, and the parabolic arcs of projectiles. Each of them was a corollary of the inverse-square law and F = ma. This appeal to deductive reasoning shocked Newton’s colleagues and disturbed them on philosophical grounds. Many of them were empiricists. They thought that logic applied only within mathematics itself.

## Harmony
### Wave of Mind
We often describe our emotions or state of mind as peaceful like a lake or tempestuous as the sea. We have certainly seen lakes and seas, and we have felt our feelings, but how is it that we naturally related the two concepts? 

A key feature of wave is periodicity. We see the waves rise and fall, and we feel our emotions come and go.
