# Training

# Association
Whether we use language or images or whatever inputs and outputs, a network connects inputs to outputs, replace those words with "ideas" and we see that a network can be interpreted exactly as an association machine. 

## On Convergence of Inference
### Bias Variance Tradeoff
If network complexity is low, the final result has to be similar?

### Parameter VS Idea (Implicit VS Explicit Thought)
It looks like that parameters are just numbers and they can not be interpreted as we interpret inputs or outputs which carry real life meanings. The key thing to remember here is that we don't think with the hidden variables, we think with the explicit things, the input output of network, or our inner speech. The grammar behind our daily language could never be explicitly queried? We can only indirectly query our mind by sending a thought in and get a thought out. An idea of verbs following subject before learning what verb or subject is can only be done by sending in numerous "verbs" and "subjects" and define whatever the invariant part of the output is as our idea of verb or subject (But this ultimately relates to where consciousness resides since intermediate neurons might also be part of access consciousness)
