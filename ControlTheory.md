# Stochastic Processes
## Macro
### Poisson

### Markov Chain {S, P}
States are set once and for all. God picks a state as time goes by according to a set of probablistic rules

E.g. Drunk man, Brownian motion

### MDP {S, A, P, R}
Action can influence transition probability distribution and usually we want to find an action/sequence of actions that maximize rewards.


### POMDP {S, A, P, R, â„¦, O}

## Physics
### Brownian Motion

### Entropy

### Boltzmann Distribution
