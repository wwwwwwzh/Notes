# Brain-AI
## Low Level
- A simple spatial temporal probabilistic network configured solely by connection and initialization.
- A simple training scheme with above model

## High Level
- Natural, neural, and network convergence
- Prediction of next frame of world with and without interaction by self. (how to train/what's objective/what network structure supports spontanneous learning)
- Objective of language and vision
- Objective: a function either serve an objective or is an result of a structure serving another objective
