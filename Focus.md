# Brain-AI
## Low Level
- A simple spatial temporal probabilistic network configured solely by connection and initialization.
- A simple training scheme with above model
- Physics inspired short term memory as smooth surface with incoming stimuli rolling and leaving trace

## High Level
- Natural, neural, and network convergence
- Objective of language and vision
- On Objective: a function either serve an objective or is an result of a structure serving an objective

### Specific Project
- Without explicitly asking, make a vision-language system that develop mathematical and physical generalizations naturally.
- Prediction of next frame of world with and without interaction by self. (how to train/what's objective/what network structure supports spontanneous learning)
- Jointly predict the whole action consequence (input current understanding of scene and action description, output low res imagined time frame and complete action trajectory) and high time resolution visual consequences (input current frame, action and tactile feedback, output next frame and feedback). Use surprise as strong weigght change indicator. Hidden variables should include: intuitive physics, self, 

## Analyze These
### Language Loop
- when facts were made (facta facta?)

### Intuitive Physics
- Imagine viewing self outside current location
- Map drawing
- Connecting map and known world
- Imagination while reading book
- Viewing cartoon or magical movie 
- Why good guys always win in movies
