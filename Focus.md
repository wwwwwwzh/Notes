# Brain-AI
## Low Level
- A simple spatial temporal probabilistic network configured solely by connection and initialization.
- A simple training scheme with above model
- Physics inspired short term memory as smooth surface with incoming stimuli rolling and leaving trace
- LSTM vs brain, how to represent and continuously update memory with any network.

## High Level
- Natural, neural, and network convergence
- Objective of language and vision
- On Objective: a function either serve an objective or is an result of a structure serving an objective

### Specific Project
- Without explicitly asking, make a vision-language system that develop mathematical and physical generalizations naturally.
- Since RNN and later Transformer approximate recurrent short term network (See ML/Dynamic Network), we can train transformer to tell if next frame is right, which can be approximated by predicting the next frame directly
- Prediction of next frame of world with and without interaction by self. (how to train/what's objective/what network structure supports spontanneous learning)
- Jointly predict the whole action consequence (input current understanding of scene and action description, output low res imagined time frame and complete action trajectory) and high time resolution visual consequences (input current frame, action and tactile feedback, output next frame and feedback). Use surprise as strong weigght change indicator. Hidden variables should include: intuitive physics, self, (Why doing is better than watching? Because you have control of every variable and is observing causation more than mere correlation)
- Pinpoint activations/group of neurons responsible for specific ideas by diverse inputs (verb, tall, rich, not, car...)
- A small LM runs in loop to produce outputs, the intermidiary outputs should be reasonable intermiadiary thought processes for that input and could be aligned using LLM.


## Analyze These
### Language Loop
- when facts were made (facta facta?)
- define abstract ideas (space, time, science) vs using these words and define less abstract ideas (happy, big, falling, moving) vs using them
- islamic republic, MAGA, deep state

### Intuitive Physics
- Imagine viewing self outside current location
- Map drawing
- Connecting map and known world
- Imagination while reading book
- Viewing cartoon or magical movie 
- Why good guys always win in movies
