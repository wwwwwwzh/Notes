# Vision
## Pixel Coordinate
Staring at bright light and close eye. Moving head maintains that light's relative position in the "big black frontal screen". Moving eyeball changes its position but maintains offset from center of gaze.

## Retina


## Movement
### Others
The buildings shown in this image is more easily seen when the picture moves, even scaling works.

## Pathway
### Scene Familiarization
It seems that when exploring environments dynamically, both pathways are active. But when statically examining, it's predominantly ventral. But once we get familirized, we concern more about how to deal with objects instead of sensing them.

# Learning
## Building Blocks
### Contrast & Similarity
On a primitive level, contrast exists in all sensual processing. A dark light is perceived differently than a bright light. A sharp pain is different from a slow one. On a higher level, we learned to contrast ideas. For example, we know a circle is different from a square by associating the strait edges with square and the symmetrical curviness with circle. But when we approximate a circle with polygons, it feels natural that a similarity is growing between the two shapes.

### Association

## Things that are there
### Algorithms
Neural circuits are powerful enough to approximate any function and we shouldn't doubt if some function is too complex for biological structures. e.g. pitch differentiation is logarithmic. 

# Memory
## Fundamental Theorem
1. All memory results from association i.e. adjustment of synaptic strength between neurons
2. Memory strength is a function of time and initial strength. 
3. Each association has its own strength function (doesn't need to naturally decline)
3.5. Association and dissociation are the same

### Face Similar But Can't Recall
Someone looks familiar but can't remember who he resembles whatsoever until you see that person and suddenly knows that's the one you are looking for. Might be related to unidirection and central theorem two

# Consciousness
### Stop of Noise
At the instant of the stop, you remember/are aware of both the noise before stop and the quietness immediately after. But if no such sudden stop happened, you are neither aware of the noise nor will remember the sound of the noise.

### Why Do We Need Attention or Focus and Much more Energy When We Are Trying to be Precise
e.g. you have a instant thought that sth is true and have a quick thought and seems like you can prove it. but it takes more time and determination to really pin it done. and you can't do this when you're tired


# Major Questions
- Neural circuits that support episodic memory
- When distant neurons corresponding to originally distant ideas are associated, how does the synapse take short cuts
- Are there really different types of functions of neural circuits? imitation->episodic memory->difference&similarity(pattern)->
Reward vs non reward based learning

# Minor Questions
- Drawing: hand drawing->scribbles->shapes->patterns
- time and place cells in hippocampus. necessary or byproduct
- People say brain learn with few examples. But don't forget how biased we can be: we justify a claim by just one example; we base our judgement for one day on something happening for one minute... In addition, we fail to learn many things with few shots. We can't recognize similar faces at first. We can't easily directly learn a language without grammar background. We have to sometimes infer priors to make sense of observations
- Why concentration and precise language is hard? Does precision require more detail as in visual imagination? I think yes. You first think of something vague, then you its content is used to relate to something more, with more details, then you iteratively add more detail to your description, either visual or linguistic, to obtain something as precise as you want it to be (as away from counter examples)

# Notes
- look around system: 1. intuitive systems (curiosity, biological needs...) 2. recognize seen objects 3. tell if familiar objects changed 4. tell if objects doesn't conform to mental model 5. physics
- non fixed length attention: each word sequentially generates KVQ. output either start of response or latent (continue to listen)
