# Thought

# Idea
In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are the results of thought. Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being.

The word idea comes from Greek ἰδέα idea "form, pattern", from the root of ἰδεῖν idein, "to see."

The argument over the underlying nature of ideas is opened by Plato, whose exposition of his theory of forms

# Reasoning

# Proposition
A proposition is a central concept in the philosophy of language, semantics, logic, and related fields, often characterized as the primary **bearer of truth or falsity**.

A proposition can also be thought of as a kind of idea: Collins Dictionary has a definition for proposition as "a statement or an idea that people can consider or discuss whether it is true."

Formally, propositions are often modeled as functions which map a possible world (see logic/possible worlds) to a truth value.

## categorical proposition
In logic, a categorical proposition, or categorical statement, is a proposition that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the subject term) are included in another (the predicate term).[1] The study of arguments using categorical statements (i.e., syllogisms) forms an important branch of deductive reasoning that began with the Ancient Greeks.

The Ancient Greeks such as Aristotle identified four primary distinct types of categorical proposition and gave them standard forms (now often called A, E, I, and O). If, abstractly, the subject category is named S and the predicate category is named P, the four standard forms are:

## Premise
A premise is a proposition used in an argument to prove the truth of another proposition called the conclusion. Arguments consist of a set of premises and a conclusion.


# Statement
In logic and semantics, the term statement is variously understood to mean either:

- a meaningful declarative sentence that is true or false, or
- a proposition. Which is the assertion that is made by (i.e., the meaning of) a true or false declarative sentence.

In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement.

# Inference
Inferences are *steps in reasoning*, moving from *premises* to *logical consequences*; etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE).

## Definition (ambiguous)
Two possible definitions of "inference" are:
1. A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
2. The process of reaching such a conclusion.

### Inference as Process
The validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word "valid" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference. An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true. But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.

## Deductive 
### Syllogism
A categorical syllogism consists of three parts:

1. Major premise
2. Minor premise
3. Conclusion

# Logic
## Possible World
A possible world is a complete and consistent way the world is or could have been. Possible worlds are widely used as a formal device in logic, philosophy, and linguistics in order to provide a semantics for intensional and modal logic.

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of God and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the best of all possible worlds". Arthur Schopenhauer argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.

At least since Aristotle, philosophers have been greatly concerned with the logical statuses of propositions, e.g. necessity, contingency, and impossibility. In the twentieth century, possible worlds have been used to explicate these notions. In modal logic, a proposition is understood in terms of the worlds in which it is true and worlds in which it is false. Thus, equivalences like the following have been proposed:

- True propositions are those that are true in the actual world
- False propositions are those that are false in the actual world
- Possible propositions are those that are true in at least one possible world (for example: "Hubert Humphrey became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
- Impossible propositions (or necessarily false propositions) are those that are true in no possible world (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
- Necessarily true propositions (often simply called necessary propositions) are those that are true in all possible worlds (for example: "2 + 2 = 4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").
- Contingent propositions are those that are true in some possible worlds and false in others (for example: "Richard Nixon became president in 1969" is contingently true and "Hubert Humphrey became president in 1969" is contingently false).

## Argument–deduction–proof distinctions
### Argument
An argument, more fully a premise–conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion.

### Deduction
A deduction is a 3 part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates – steps of reasoning (inference) showing that its conclusion is a consequence of its premises. 

### Proof
A proof is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A proof of the Pythagorean theorem is a deduction that might use several premises – axioms, postulates, and definitions – and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As Alfred Tarski famously emphasized in accord with Aristotle, truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.

## Propositional Logic
Propositional calculus is a branch of logic. It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. Propositions that contain no logical connectives are called atomic propositions.

### Basic Concepts
The following outlines a standard propositional calculus. Many different formulations exist which are all more or less equivalent, but differ in the details of:

1. their language (i.e., the particular collection of primitive symbols and operator symbols),
2. the set of axioms, or distinguished formulas, and
3. the set of inference rules.

### Generic description
A propositional calculus is a formal system L=() where:

## Abstract Structure
An abstract structure is an abstraction that might be of the geometric spaces or a set structure, or a hypostatic abstraction that is defined by a set of mathematical theorems and laws, properties and relationships in a way that is logically if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent experiences, for example, those involving physical objects.

An abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects – this is called an implementation or instantiation of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.

An abstract structure has a richer structure than a concept or an idea. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question, and it must be free from contradictions.

Examples: 
- A sorting algorithm is an abstract structure, but a recipe is not, because it depends on the properties and quantities of its ingredients.
- A simple melody is an abstract structure, but an orchestration is not, because it depends on the properties of particular instruments.
- Euclidean geometry is an abstract structure, but the theory of continental drift is not, because it depends on the geology of the Earth.
- A formal language is an abstract structure, but a natural language is not, because its rules of grammar and syntax are open to debate and interpretation.

## Formal Language
In logic, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a formal language consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules.

Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages.

The **alphabet** of a formal language consists of **symbols**/letters/tokens that concatenate into strings of the language. Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a **word**, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called **well-formed words or well-formed formulas**.

A formal language L over an alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ*, that is, a set of words over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.



## Formal System
A formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system. A formal system is essentially an "axiomatic system".

In 1921, David Hilbert proposed to use such a system as the foundation for the knowledge in mathematics. A formal system may represent a well-defined system of abstract thought.

A formal system consists of:
1. A finite set of symbols, known as the alphabet, which are concatenated into finite strings called formulas.
2. A grammar consisting of rules to form formulas from simpler formulas. A formula is said to be well-formed if it can be formed using the rules of the formal grammar. It is often required that there be a decision procedure for deciding whether a formula is well-formed.
3. A set of axioms, or axiom schemata, consisting of well-formed formulas.
4. A set of inference rules. A well-formed formula that can be inferred from the axioms is known as a theorem of the formal system.

### Proof System
A proof system includes the components:

- Language: The set L of formulas admitted by the system, for example, propositional logic or first-order logic.
- Rules of inference: List of rules that can be employed to prove theorems from axioms and theorems.
- Axioms: Formulas in L assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms.

Formal proofs are sequences of well-formed formulas (or WFF for short). For a WFF to qualify as part of a proof, it might either be an axiom or be the product of applying an inference rule on previous wffs in the proof sequence. The last wff in the sequence is recognized as a theorem.

# Mathematical Proof
A mathematical proof is a deductive argument for a mathematical statement (proposition), showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion.

Proofs employ logic expressed in mathematical symbols, along with natural language which usually admits some ambiguity. In most mathematical literature, proofs are written in terms of rigorous informal logic. Purely formal proofs, written fully in symbolic language without the involvement of natural language, are considered in proof theory.

# Domain
## Function

## Discourse
In the formal sciences, the domain of discourse, also called the universe of discourse, universal set, or simply universe, is the set of entities over which certain variables of interest in some formal treatment may range.

In every discourse, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.
